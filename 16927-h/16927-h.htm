      <a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Tacitus held the consulship under Nerva in the year 97. At this point he
      closed his public career. He had reached the goal of a politician's
      ambition and had become known as one of the best speakers of his time, but
      he seems to have realized that under the Principate politics was a dull
      farce, and that oratory was of little value in a time of peace and strong
      government. The rest of his life was to be spent in writing history. In
      the year of his consulship or immediately after it, he published the <i>Agricola</i>
      and <i>Germania</i>, short monographs in which he practised the transition
      from the style of the speaker to that of the writer. In the preface to the
      <i>Agricola</i> he foreshadows the larger work on which he is engaged. 'I
      shall find it a pleasant task to put together, though in rough and
      unfinished style, a memorial of our former slavery and a record of our
      present happiness.' His intention was to write a history of the Principate
      from Augustus to Trajan. He began with his own times, and wrote in twelve
      or fourteen books a full account of the period from Nero's death in 68
      <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> to the death of Domitian in 96 <span
      class="smcap">a.d.</span> These were published, probably in successive
      books, between 106 and 109 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> Only the first
      four and a half books survive to us. They deal with the years 69 and 70,
      and are known as <i>The Histories</i>. <i>The <a name="1page6"></a><span
      class="pagenum">6</span>Annals</i>, which soon followed, dealt with the
      Julian dynasty after the death of Augustus. Of Augustus' constitution of
      the principate and of Rome's 'present happiness' under Trajan, Tacitus did
      not live to write.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The Histories</i>, as they survive to us, describe in a style that has
      made them immortal one of the most terrible and crucial moments of Roman
      history. The deadly struggle for the throne demonstrated finally the real
      nature of the Principate&mdash;based not on constitutional fictions but on
      armed force&mdash;and the supple inefficiency of the senatorial class. The
      revolt on the Rhine foreshadowed the debacle of the fifth century. Tacitus
      was peculiarly well qualified to write the history of this period. He had
      been the eye-witness of some of the most terrible scenes: he was
      acquainted with all the distinguished survivors: his political experience
      gave him a statesman's point of view, and his rhetorical training a style
      which mirrored both the terror of the times and his own emotion. More than
      any other Roman historian he desired to tell the truth and was not fatally
      biassed by prejudice. It is wrong to regard Tacitus as an 'embittered
      rhetorician', an 'enemy of the Empire', a 'd&eacute;tracteur de l'humanit&eacute;'.<a
      name="1fnm1"></a><a href="#1fn1" class="fnnum">1</a> He was none of these.
      As a member of a noble, though not an ancient, family, and as one who had
      completed the republican <i>cursus honorum</i>, his sympathies were
      naturally senatorial. He regretted that the days were passed when oratory
      was a real power and the consuls were the twin towers of the world. But he
      never hoped <a name="1page7"></a><span class="pagenum">7</span>to see such
      days again. He realized that monarchy was essential to peace, and that the
      price of freedom was violence and disorder. He had no illusions about the
      senate. Fault and misfortune had reduced them to nerveless servility, a
      luxury of self-abasement. Their meekness would never inherit the earth.
      Tacitus pours scorn on the philosophic opponents of the Principate, who
      while refusing to serve the emperor and pretending to hope for the
      restoration of the republic, could contribute nothing more useful than an
      ostentatious suicide. His own career, and still more the career of his
      father-in-law Agricola, showed that even under bad emperors a man could be
      great without dishonour. Tacitus was no republican in any sense of the
      word, but rather a monarchist <i>malgr&eacute; lui</i>. There was nothing
      for it but to pray for good emperors and put up with bad ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who decry Tacitus for prejudice against the Empire forget that he is
      describing emperors who were indubitably bad. We have lost his account of
      Vespasian's reign. His praise of Augustus and of Trajan was never written.
      The emperors whom he depicts for us were all either tyrannical or
      contemptible, or both: no floods of modern biography can wash them white.
      They seemed to him to have degraded Roman life and left no room for <i>virtus</i>
      in the world. The verdict of Rome had gone against them. So he devotes to
      their portraiture the venom which the fifteen years of Domitian's reign of
      terror had engendered in his heart. He was inevitably a pessimist; his
      ideals lay <a name="1page8"></a><span class="pagenum">8</span>in the past;
      yet he clearly shows that he had some hope of the future. Without sharing
      Pliny's faith that the millennium had dawned, he admits that Nerva and
      Trajan have inaugurated 'happier times' and combined monarchy with some
      degree of personal freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are other reasons for the 'dark shadows' in Tacitus' work. History
      to a Roman was <i>opus oratorium,</i> a work of literary art. Truth is a
      great but not a sufficient merit. The historian must be not only <i>narrator</i>
      but <i>ornator rerum</i>. He must carefully select and arrange the
      incidents, compose them into an effective group, and by the power of
      language make them memorable and alive. In these books Tacitus has little
      but horrors to describe: his art makes them unforgettably horrible. The
      same art is ready to display the beauty of courage and self-sacrifice. But
      these were rarer phenomena than cowardice and greed. It was not Tacitus,
      but the age, which showed a preference for vice. Moreover, the historian's
      art was not to be used solely for its own sake. All ancient history was
      written with a moral object; the ethical interest predominates almost to
      the exclusion of all others. Tacitus is never merely literary. The &#963;&#949;&#956;&#957;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962;
      which Pliny notes as the characteristic of his oratory, never lets him
      sparkle to no purpose. All his pictures have a moral object 'to rescue
      virtue from oblivion and restrain vice by the terror of posthumous
      infamy'.<a name="1fnm2"></a><a href="#1fn2" class="fnnum">2</a> His prime
      interest is character: and when he has <a name="1page9"></a><span
      class="pagenum">9</span>conducted some skilful piece of moral diagnosis
      there attaches to his verdict some of the severity of a sermon. If you
      want to make men better you must uncover and scarify their sins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few Christian moralists deal much in eulogy, and Tacitus' diatribes are
      the more frequent and the more fierce because his was the morality not of
      Christ but of Rome. 'The Poor' are as dirt to him: he can stoop to
      immortalize some gleam of goodness in low life, but even then his main
      object is by scorn of contrast to galvanize the aristocracy into better
      ways. Only in them can true <i>virtus</i> grow. Their degradation seems
      the death of goodness. Tacitus had little sympathy with the social
      revolution that was rapidly completing itself, not so much because those
      who rose from the masses lacked 'blood', but because they had not been
      trained in the right traditions. In the decay of Education he finds a
      prime cause of evil. And being a Roman&mdash;wherever he may have been
      born&mdash;he inevitably feels that the decay of Roman life must rot the
      world. His eyes are not really open to the Empire. He never seems to think
      that in the spacious provinces to which the old Roman virtues had taken
      flight, men were leading happy, useful lives, because the strong hand of
      the imperial government had come to save them from the inefficiency of
      aristocratic governors. This narrowness of view accounts for much of
      Tacitus' pessimism.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recognition of the atmosphere in which Tacitus wrote and the objects at
      which his history aimed helps <a name="1page10"></a><span class="pagenum">10</span>one
      to understand why it sometimes disappoints modern expectations. Particular
      scenes are seared on our memories: persons stand before us lit to the soul
      by a fierce light of psychological analysis: we learn to loath the
      characteristic vices of the time, and to understand the moral causes of
      Roman decadence. But somehow the dominance of the moral interest and the
      frequent interruption of the narrative by scenes of senatorial
      inefficiency serve to obscure the plain sequence of events. It is
      difficult after a first reading of the <i>Histories</i> to state clearly
      what happened in these two years. And this difficulty is vastly annoying
      to experts who wish to trace the course of the three campaigns. Those
      whose interest is not in Tacitus but in the military history of the period
      are recommended to study Mr. B.W. Henderson's <i>Civil War and Rebellion
      in the Roman Empire</i>, a delightful book which makes the dark places
      plain. But they are not recommended to share his contempt for Tacitus
      because his accounts of warfare are as bad as, for instance,
      Shakespeare's. Tacitus does not describe in detail the tactics and
      geography of a campaign, perhaps because he could not do so, certainly
      because he did not wish to. He regarded such details as dry bones, which
      no amount of literary skill could animate. His interest is in human
      character. Plans of campaign throw little light on that: so they did not
      interest him, or, if they did, he suppressed his interest because he knew
      that his public would otherwise behave as Dr. Johnson did when Fox talked
      to him of Catiline's <a name="1page11"></a><span class="pagenum">11</span>conspiracy.
      'He withdrew his attention and thought about Tom Thumb.'
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no worse fault in criticism than to blame a work of art for
      lacking qualities to which it makes no pretension. Tacitus is not a 'bad
      military historian'. He is not a 'military' historian at all. Botticelli
      is not a botanist, nor is Shakespeare a geographer. It is this fault which
      leads critics to call Tacitus 'a stilted pleader at a decadent bar', and
      to complain that his narrative of the war with Civilis is 'made dull and
      unreal by speeches'&mdash;because they have not found in Tacitus what they
      had no right to look for. Tacitus inserts speeches for the same reason
      that he excludes tactical details. They add to the human interest of his
      work. They give scope to his great dramatic powers, to that passionate
      sympathy with character which finds expression in a style as nervous as
      itself. They enable him to display motives, to appraise actions, to reveal
      moral forces. It is interest in human nature rather than pride of rhetoric
      which makes him love a good debate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supreme distinction of Tacitus is, of course, his style. That is lost
      in a translation. 'Hard' though his Latin is, it is not obscure. Careful
      attention can always detect his exact thought. Like Meredith he is 'hard'
      because he does so much with words. Neither writer leaves any doubt about
      his meaning. It is therefore a translator's first duty to be lucid, and
      not until that duty is done may he try by faint flushes of epigram to
      reflect something of the brilliance of <a name="1page12"></a><span
      class="pagenum">12</span>Tacitus' Latin. Very faint indeed that reflection
      must always be: probably no audience could be found to listen to a
      translation of Tacitus, yet one feels that his Latin would challenge and
      hold the attention of any audience that was not stone-deaf. But it is
      because Tacitus is never a mere stylist that some of us continue in the
      failure to translate him. His historical deductions and his revelations of
      character have their value for every age. 'This form of history,' says
      Montaigne, 'is by much the most useful ... there are in it more precepts
      than stories: it is not a book to read, 'tis a book to study and learn:
      'tis full of sententious opinions, right or wrong: 'tis a nursery of ethic
      and politic discourses, for the use and ornament of those who have any
      place in the government of the world.... His pen seems most proper for a
      troubled and sick state, as ours at present is; you would often say it is
      us he paints and pinches.' Sir Henry Savile, Warden of Merton and Provost
      of Eton, who translated the <i>Histories</i> into racy Elizabethan English
      at a time when the state was neither 'troubled' nor 'sick' is as convinced
      as Montaigne or the theorists of the French Revolution that Tacitus had
      lessons for his age. 'In Galba thou maiest learne, that a Good Prince
      gouerned by evill ministers is as dangerous as if he were evill himselfe.
      By Otho, that the fortune of a rash man is <i>Torrenti similis</i>, which
      rises at an instant, and falles in a moment. By Vitellius, that he that
      hath no vertue can neuer be happie: for by his own baseness he will loose
      all, which either fortune, or other mens labours <a name="1page13"></a><span
      class="pagenum">13</span>have cast upon him. By Vespasian, that in civill
      tumults an advised patience, and opportunitie well taken are the onely
      weapons of advantage. In them all, and in the state of Rome under them
      thou maiest see the calamities that follow civill warres, where lawes lie
      asleepe, and all things are iudged by the sword. If thou mislike their
      warres be thankfull for thine owne peace; if thou dost abhor their
      tyrannies, love and reverence thine owne wise, iust and excellent Prince.'
      So whatever guise our age may assume, there are lessons to be drawn from
      Tacitus either directly or <i>per contra</i>, and his translators may be
      acquitted at a time when Latin scholarship is no longer an essential of
      political eminence.

      <a name="Ichap1" id="Ichap1"></a><span class="chapnum">1</span>[<span
      class="smcap">a.d.</span> 69.] I propose to begin my narrative with the
      second consulship of Servius Galba, in which Titus Vinius was his
      colleague. Many historians have dealt with the 820 years of the earlier
      period beginning with the foundation of Rome, and the story of the Roman
      Republic has been told with no less ability than truth. After the Battle
      of Actium, when the interests of peace were served by the centralization
      of all authority in the hands of one man, there followed a dearth of
      literary ability, and at the same time truth suffered more and more,
      partly from ignorance of politics, which were no longer a citizen's
      concern, partly from the growing taste for flattery or from hatred of the
      ruling house. So between malice on one side and servility on the other the
      interests of posterity were neglected. But historians find that a tone of
      flattery soon incurs the stigma of servility and earns for them the
      contempt of their readers, whereas people readily open their ears to the
      criticisms of envy, since malice makes a show of independence. Of Galba,
      Otho, and Vitellius, I have known nothing either to my advantage or my
      hurt. I cannot deny that I originally owed my position to Vespasian, or
      that I was advanced by Titus and still <a name="1page18"></a><span
      class="pagenum">18</span>further promoted by Domitian;<a name="1fnm5"></a><a
      href="#1fn5" class="fnnum">5</a> but professing, as I do, unbiassed
      honesty, I must speak of no man either with hatred or affection. I have
      reserved for my old age, if life is spared to me, the reigns of the
      sainted Nerva and of the Emperor Trajan, which afford a richer and withal
      a safer theme:<a name="1fnm6"></a><a href="#1fn6" class="fnnum">6</a> for
      it is the rare fortune of these days that a man may think what he likes
      and say what he thinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap2" id="Ichap2"></a><span class="chapnum">2</span>The story I
      now commence is rich in vicissitudes, grim with warfare, torn by civil
      strife, a tale of horror even during times of peace. It tells of four
      emperors slain by the sword, three several civil wars, an even larger
      number of foreign wars and some that were both at once: successes in the
      East, disaster in the West, disturbance in Illyricum, disaffection in the
      provinces of Gaul, the conquest of Britain and its immediate loss, the
      rising of the Sarmatian and Suebic tribes. It tells how Dacia had the
      privilege of exchanging blows with Rome, and how a pretender claiming to
      be Nero almost deluded the Parthians into declaring war. Now too Italy was
      smitten with new disasters, or disasters it had not witnessed for a long
      period of years. Towns along the rich coast of Campania were <a
      name="1page19"></a><span class="pagenum">19</span>submerged or buried. The
      city was devastated by fires, ancient temples were destroyed, and the
      Capitol itself was fired by Roman hands. Sacred rites were grossly
      profaned, and there were scandals in high <a name="1fnm7"></a>places.<a
      href="#1fn7" class="fnnum">7</a> The sea swarmed with exiles and the
      island <a name="1fnm8"></a>cliffs<a href="#1fn8" class="fnnum">8</a> were
      red with blood. Worse horrors reigned in the city. To be rich or well-born
      was a crime: men were prosecuted for holding or for refusing office: merit
      of any kind meant certain ruin. Nor were the Informers more hated for
      their crimes than for their prizes: some carried off a priesthood or the
      consulship as their spoil, others won offices and influence in the
      imperial household: the hatred and fear they inspired worked universal
      havoc. Slaves were bribed against their masters, freedmen against their
      patrons, and, if a man had no enemies, he was ruined by his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap3" id="Ichap3"></a><span class="chapnum">3</span>However,
      the period was not so utterly barren as to yield no examples of heroism.
      There were mothers who followed their sons, and wives their husbands into
      exile: one saw here a kinsman's courage and there a son-in-law's devotion:
      slaves obstinately faithful even on the rack: distinguished men bravely
      facing the utmost straits and matching in their end the famous deaths of
      older times. Besides these manifold disasters to mankind there were
      portents in the sky and on the earth, thunderbolts and other <a
      name="1page20"></a><span class="pagenum">20</span>premonitions of good and
      of evil, some doubtful, some obvious. Indeed never has it been proved by
      such terrible disasters to Rome or by such clear evidence that Providence
      is concerned not with our peace of mind but rather with vengeance for our
      sin.

    </h3>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap4" id="Ichap4"></a><span class="chapnum">4</span>Before I
      commence my task, it seems best to go back and consider the state of
      affairs in the city, the temper of the armies, the condition of the
      provinces, and to determine the elements of strength and weakness in the
      different quarters of the Roman world. By this means we may see not only
      the actual course of events, which is largely governed by chance, but also
      why and how they occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      The death of Nero, after the first outburst of joy with which it was
      greeted, soon aroused conflicting feelings not only among the senators,
      the people, and the soldiers in the city, but also among the generals and
      their troops abroad. It had divulged a secret of state: an emperor could
      be made elsewhere than at Rome. Still the senate was satisfied. They had
      immediately taken advantage of their liberty and were naturally emboldened
      against a prince who was new to the throne and, moreover, absent. The
      highest class of the <a name="1fnm9"></a>knights<a href="#1fn9"
      class="fnnum">9</a> seconded the senate's satisfaction. Respectable
      citizens, who were attached as clients or freedmen to the great families,
      and had seen their <a name="1page21"></a><span class="pagenum">21</span>patrons
      condemned or exiled, now revived their hopes. The lowest classes, who had
      grown familiar with the pleasures of the theatre and the circus, the most
      degraded of the slaves, and Nero's favourites who had squandered their
      property and lived on his discreditable bounty, all showed signs of
      depression and an eager greed for news.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap5" id="Ichap5"></a><span class="chapnum">5</span>The troops
      in the <a name="1fnm10"></a>city<a href="#1fn10" class="fnnum">10</a> had
      long been inured to the allegiance of the Caesars, and it was more by the
      pressure of intrigue than of their own inclination that they came to
      desert Nero. They soon realized that the donation promised in Galba's name
      was not to be paid to them, and that peace would not, like war, offer
      opportunity for great services and rich rewards. Since they also saw that
      the new emperor's favour had been forestalled by the army which proclaimed
      him, they were ripe for revolution and were further instigated by their
      rascally Praefect Nymphidius Sabinus, who was plotting to be emperor
      himself. His design was as a matter of fact detected and quashed, but,
      though the ringleader was removed, many of the troops still felt conscious
      of their treason and could be heard commenting on Galba's senility and
      avarice. His austerity&mdash;a quality once admired and set high in
      soldiers' estimation&mdash;only annoyed troops whose contempt for the old
      methods of discipline had been fostered by fourteen years of service <a
      name="1page22"></a><span class="pagenum">22</span>under Nero. They had
      come to love the emperors' vices as much as they once reverenced their
      virtues in older days. Moreover Galba had let fall a remark, which augured
      well for Rome, though it spelt danger to himself. 'I do not buy my
      soldiers,' he said, 'I select them.' And indeed, as things then stood, his
      words sounded incongruous.

      <a name="Ichap6" id="Ichap6"></a><span class="chapnum">6</span>Galba was
      old and ill. Of his two lieutenants Titus Vinius was the vilest of men and
      Cornelius Laco the laziest. Hated as he was for Vinius' crimes and
      despised for Laco's inefficiency, between them Galba soon came to ruin.
      His march from Spain was slow and stained with bloodshed. He executed
      Cingonius Varro, the consul-elect, and Petronius Turpilianus, an
      ex-consul, the former as an accomplice of Nymphidius, the latter as one of
      Nero's generals. They were both denied any opportunity of a hearing or
      defence&mdash;and might as well have been innocent. On his arrival at Rome
      the butchery of thousands of unarmed <a name="1fnm11"></a>soldiers<a
      href="#1fn11" class="fnnum">11</a> gave an ill omen to his entry, and
      alarmed even the men who did the slaughter. The city was filled with
      strange troops. A legion had been brought from Spain,<a name="1fnm12"></a><a
      href="#1fn12" class="fnnum">12</a> and the regiment of marines enrolled by
      Nero still remained.<a href="#1fn11" class="fnnum">11</a> Moreover there
      were several detachments <a name="1page23"></a><span class="pagenum">23</span>from
      Germany, Britain, and <a name="1fnm13"></a>Illyricum,<a href="#1fn13"
      class="fnnum">13</a> which had been selected by Nero, dispatched to the
      Caspian <a name="1fnm14"></a>Pass<a href="#1fn14" class="fnnum">14</a> for
      the projected war against the Albanians, and subsequently recalled to aid
      in crushing the revolt of <a name="1fnm15"></a><a href="#1fn15"
      class="fnnum">15</a> These were all fine fuel for a revolution, and,
      although their favour centred on nobody in particular, there they were at
      the disposal of any one who had enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap7" id="Ichap7"></a><span class="chapnum">7</span>It happened
      by chance that the news of the death of Clodius Macer and of Fonteius
      Capito arrived in Rome simultaneously. Macer,<a name="1fnm16"></a><a
      href="#1fn16" class="fnnum">16</a> who was undoubtedly raising a
      disturbance in Africa, was put to death by the imperial agent Trebonius
      Garutianus, acting under Galba's orders: <a name="1fnm17"></a>Capito<a
      href="#1fn17" class="fnnum">17</a> had made a similar attempt in Germany
      and was killed by two officers, Cornelius Aquinus and Fabius Valens,
      without waiting for instructions. While Capito had a foul reputation for
      extortion and loose living, some people yet believed <a name="1page24"></a><span
      class="pagenum">24</span>that he had withheld his hand from treason. His
      officers, they supposed, had urged him to declare war, and, when they
      could not persuade him, had gone on to charge him falsely with their own
      offence,<a name="1fnm18"></a><a href="#1fn18" class="fnnum">18</a> while
      Galba from weakness of character, or perhaps because he was afraid to
      inquire too far, approved what had happened for good or for ill, since it
      was past alteration. At any rate both executions were unpopular. Now that
      Galba was disliked, everything he did, whether right or wrong, made him
      more unpopular. His freedmen were all-powerful: money could do anything:
      the slaves were thirsting for an upheaval, and with so elderly an emperor
      were naturally expecting to see one soon. The evils of the new court were
      those of the old, and while equally oppressive were not so easily excused.
      Even Galba's age seemed comic and despicable to a populace that was used
      to the young Nero and compared the emperors, as such people will, in point
      of looks and personal attraction.

    </h3>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap8" id="Ichap8"></a><span class="chapnum">8</span>Such then
      at Rome was the variety of feeling natural in so vast a population. To
      turn to the provinces abroad: Spain was under the command of Cluvius
      Rufus, a man of great eloquence, and more skilled in the arts of peace
      than of <a name="1fnm19"></a>war.<a href="#1fn19" class="fnnum">19</a> The
      Gallic provinces had not forgotten : moreover, they <a name="1page25"></a><span
      class="pagenum">25</span>were bound to Galba by his recent grant of Roman
      citizenship and his rebate of their tribute for the future. The tribes,
      however, which lay nearest to the armies stationed in Germany had not
      received these honours: some even had lost part of their territory and
      were equally aggrieved at the magnitude of their own injuries and of their
      neighbours' benefits. The troops in Germany were proud of their recent
      victory, indignant at their treatment and perplexed by a nervous
      consciousness that they had supported the wrong side: a very dangerous
      state for so strong a force to be in. They had been slow to desert Nero,
      and <a name="1fnm20"></a>Verginius<a href="#1fn20" class="fnnum">20</a>
      did not immediately declare for Galba. Whether he really did not want the
      throne is doubtful: without question his soldiers made him the offer. The
      death of Fonteius Capito aroused the indignation even of those who had no
      right to complain. However, they still lacked a leader: Galba had sent for
      Verginius under a pretence of friendship, and, when he was not allowed to
      return and was even charged with treachery, the soldiers considered his
      case their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap9" id="Ichap9"></a><span class="chapnum">9</span>The army of
      Upper Germany felt no respect for their commander, Hordeonius <a
      name="1fnm21"></a>Flaccus.<a href="#1fn21" class="fnnum">21</a> Weakened
      by age and an affection of the feet he was without resolution or
      authority, and could not have controlled the mildest troops. These fiery
      spirits were only the further inflamed when they felt such a weak hand on
      the reins. The legions of Lower Germany had been <a name="1page26"></a><span
      class="pagenum">26</span>for some time without a commander,<a name="1fnm22"></a><a
      href="#1fn22" class="fnnum">22</a> until Aulus Vitellius appeared. He was
      the son of the Lucius Vitellius who had been censor and thrice <a
      name="1fnm23"></a>consul,<a href="#1fn23" class="fnnum">23</a> and Galba
      thought this sufficient to impress the troops. The army in Britain showed
      no bad feeling. All through the disturbance of the civil wars no troops
      kept cleaner hands. This may have been because they were so far away and
      severed by the sea, or perhaps frequent engagements had taught them to
      keep their rancour for the enemy. Quiet ruled in Illyricum also, although
      the legions, which had been summoned by <a name="1fnm24"></a>Nero,<a
      href="#1fn24" class="fnnum">24</a> while lingering in Italy had made
      overtures to Verginius. But the armies lay far apart, always a sound
      assistance to the maintenance of military discipline, since the men could
      neither share vices nor join forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap10" id="Ichap10"></a><span class="chapnum">10</span>The East
      was still untroubled. Licinius Mucianus held Syria with four <a
      name="1fnm25"></a>legions.<a href="#1fn25" class="fnnum">25</a> He was a
      man who was always famous, whether in good fortune or in bad. As a youth
      he was ambitious and cultivated the friendship of the great. Later he
      found himself in straitened circumstances and a very ambiguous position,
      and, suspecting Claudius' displeasure, he withdrew into the wilds of Asia,
      where he came as near to being an exile as afterwards to being an emperor.
      He was <a name="1page27"></a><span class="pagenum">27</span>a strange
      mixture of good and bad, of luxury and industry, courtesy and arrogance.
      In leisure he was self-indulgent, but full of vigour on service. His
      outward behaviour was praiseworthy, though ill was spoken of his private
      life. However, with those who were under him or near him, and with his
      colleagues he gained great influence by various devices, and seems to have
      been the sort of man who would more readily make an emperor than be one.

    <p>
      The Jewish war was being conducted by Flavius Vespasianus&mdash;appointed
      by Nero&mdash;with three <a name="1fnm26"></a>legions.<a href="#1fn26"
      class="fnnum">26</a> He had no ill-will against Galba, and nothing to hope
      from his fall. Indeed he had sent his son Titus to carry his compliments
      and offer allegiance, an incident we must reserve for its proper <a
      name="1fnm27"></a>place.<a href="#1fn27" class="fnnum">27</a> It was only
      after Vespasian's rise that Roman society came to believe in the
      mysterious movings of Providence, and supposed that portents and oracles
      had predestined the throne for him and his family.

      were ready to put up with any ruler after their experience of a petty
      master. The two Mauretanias, Raetia, Noricum, Thrace, and the other
      provinces governed by procurators had their sympathies determined by the
      neighbourhood of troops, and always caught their likes or dislikes from
      the strongest army. The ungarrisoned provinces, and chief amongst these
      Italy, were destined to be the prize of war, and lay at the mercy of any
      master. Such was the state of the Roman world when Servius Galba, consul
      for the second time, and Titus Vinius his colleague, inaugurated the year
      which was to be their last, and almost the last for the commonwealth of
      Rome.

      and the Adoption of Piso
    </h3>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap12" id="Ichap12"></a><span class="chapnum">12</span>A few
      days after the first of January a dispatch arrived from Belgica, in which
      Pompeius <a name="1fnm32"></a>Propinquus,<a href="#1fn32" class="fnnum">32</a>
      the imperial agent, announced that the legions of <a name="1page29"></a><span
      class="pagenum">29</span>Upper Germany had broken their oath of allegiance
      and were clamouring for a new emperor, but that by way of tempering their
      treason they referred the final choice to the Senate and People of Rome.
      Galba had already been deliberating and seeking advice as to the adoption
      of a successor, and this occurrence hastened his plans. During all these
      months this question formed the current subject of gossip throughout the
      country; Galba was far spent in years and the general propensity for such
      a topic knew no check. Few people showed sound judgement or any spirit of
      patriotism. Many were influenced by foolish hopes and spread
      self-interested rumours pointing to some friend or patron, thereby also
      gratifying their hatred for Titus <a name="1fnm33"></a>Vinius,<a
      href="#1fn33" class="fnnum">33</a> whose unpopularity waxed daily with his
      power. Galba's affability only served to strengthen the gaping ambition of
      his newly powerful friends, for his weakness and credulity halved the risk
      and doubled the reward of treason.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap13" id="Ichap13"></a><span class="chapnum">13</span>The real
      power of the throne was divided between the consul, Titus Vinius, and
      Cornelius Laco, the prefect of the Guards; and an influence as great was
      enjoyed by Icelus, one of Galba's freedmen, who had been given the gold
      <a name="1fnm34"></a>ring<a href="#1fn34" class="fnnum">34</a> and was now
      greeted by the name of Marcianus. These three ordinarily disagreed, and
      followed each his own interest in smaller <a name="1page30"></a><span
      class="pagenum">30</span>matters: on the question of the succession they
      fell into two camps. Vinius was for Marcus Otho. Laco and Icelus were
      agreed not so much on any one as on any other. Galba was aware of the
      friendship between Otho and Vinius. Otho was a bachelor and Vinius had an
      unmarried daughter: so gossip, never reticent, pointed to them as father
      and son-in-law. Galba, one may suppose, felt some concern for his country,
      too. Why take the throne from Nero, if it was to be left to Otho? Otho had
      led a careless boyhood and a dissolute youth, and endeared himself to Nero
      by aping his vices. Thus it was to Otho, as being already in the secret,
      that Nero entrusted his favourite mistress, Poppaea Sabina,<a name="1fnm35"></a><a
      href="#1fn35" class="fnnum">35</a> until he could get rid of Octavia.
      Later he grew jealous and removed Otho to the province of Lusitania under
      cover of a governorship. Otho had been popular in his administration of
      the province, and was one of the first to join Galba's party. Being a man
      of action and one of the most distinguished of Galba's officers in the
      war, when once he had conceived the hope of succeeding him, he eagerly
      indulged it. Most of the soldiers were on his side and the Court supported
      him as Nero's double.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap14" id="Ichap14"></a><span class="chapnum">14</span>After
      receiving the news of the German revolt, although Galba knew nothing for
      certain of Vitellius' <a name="1page31"></a><span class="pagenum">31</span>plans,
      he was fearful to what lengths the outbreak of the troops might go; so,
      being unable to trust the troops in the <a name="1fnm36"></a>city,<a
      href="#1fn36" class="fnnum">36</a> he had recourse to what seemed his sole
      remedy and held an Imperial Election. Besides Vinius and Laco he summoned
      Marius Celsus, consul-elect and the City-Prefect Ducenius <a name="1fnm37"></a>Geminus.<a
      href="#1fn37" class="fnnum">37</a> After prefacing a few words about his
      own advanced age he ordered Piso <a name="1fnm38"></a>Licinianus<a
      href="#1fn38" class="fnnum">38</a> to be sent for, either on his own
      initiative, or, as some believed, at the instance of Laco. Laco had met
      Piso at Rubellius Plautus' house and they had formed a friendship, but he
      cunningly pretended that he was supporting a stranger, and Piso's good
      repute gave colour to this policy. Piso was a noble on both sides, being
      the son of Marcus Crassus and Scribonia. There was an old-world austerity
      in his face and bearing, and just critics spoke of his strict morality:
      people who took a less favourable view thought him soured. But while those
      who disliked this side of his character carped at it, it was a
      recommendation in the eyes of the emperor who intended to adopt him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap15" id="Ichap15"></a><span class="chapnum">15</span>Galba is
      said to have taken Piso's hand and addressed him as follows: 'Were I a
      private citizen, and were I to adopt you in the presence of the Priests
      <a name="1page32"></a><span class="pagenum">32</span>by the usual
      formality of a curial statute,<a name="1fnm39"></a><a href="#1fn39"
      class="fnnum">39</a> it would be an honour for me to introduce into my
      family a descendant of Cnaeus Pompeius and of Marcus Crassus, and for you
      it would be a distinction to add to your noble ancestry the glories of the
      Sulpician and Lutatian <a name="1fnm40"></a>houses.<a href="#1fn40"
      class="fnnum">40</a> As it is, I have been called by the consent of gods
      and men to be an emperor. Your distinguished qualities and your patriotism
      have persuaded me to offer to you peacefully and quietly the throne for
      which our ancestors fought on the field of <a name="1fnm41"></a>battle,<a
      href="#1fn41" class="fnnum">41</a> and which I too won by war. In so doing
      I am following the precedent set by the sainted Augustus, who raised to
      the rank next himself first his nephew Marcellus, then his son-in-law
      Agrippa, then his daughter's sons,<a name="1fnm42"></a><a href="#1fn42"
      class="fnnum">42</a> and finally his stepson Tiberius Nero. However, while
      Augustus looked for a successor in his own family, I have searched
      throughout the country. Not that I lack either kinsmen or supporters, but
      it was by no favour of birth that I myself came to the throne, and, to
      prove my policy in this matter, consider how I have passed over not only
      my own relatives but yours. <a name="1page33"></a><span class="pagenum">33</span>You
      have an elder <a name="1fnm43"></a>brother,<a href="#1fn43" class="fnnum">43</a>
      as noble as yourself. He would have been worthy of this position, but you
      are worthier. You are old enough to have outlived youthful passions. Your
      life has been such that you have nothing in your past to excuse. So far
      you have only experienced misfortune. Prosperity probes the heart with a
      keener touch; misery only calls for patience, but there is corruption in
      success. Honesty, candour, and affection are the best of human qualities,
      and doubtless you yourself have enough character to retain them. But the
      complaisance of others will weaken your character. Flattery and servile
      compliments will break down its defences and self-interest too, the bane
      of all sincerity. What though you and I can talk plainly with each other
      to-day? Others will address themselves not to us but to our fortunes. To
      persuade an emperor what he ought to do is a laborious task: any one can
      flatter him without a spark of sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap16" id="Ichap16"></a><span class="chapnum">16</span>'If the
      vast bulk of this empire could stand and keep its balance without a
      guiding hand, the Republic might well have dated its birth from me. As it
      is, things have long ago come to such a pass that neither I in my old age
      can give the Roman people any better gift than a good successor, nor you
      in your prime anything better than a good emperor. Under Tiberius,
      Caligula, and Claudius, Rome was the heirloom of a single family. There is
      a kind of liberty in the free choice we have begun to exercise. Now that
      the <a name="1page34"></a><span class="pagenum">34</span>Julian and
      Claudian houses are extinct, by the plan of adoption the best man will
      always be discovered. Royal birth is the gift of fortune, and is but
      valued as such. In adoption we can use a free judgement, and if we wish to
      choose well, the voice of the country points the way. Think of Nero,
      swollen with the pride of his long line of royal ancestry. It was not with
      a powerless province at his back, nor I with a single legion that freed
      Rome's shoulders of that burden: it was his own cruelty and profligacy.
      And that was before there was any precedent for the conviction of an
      emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      'We have been called to the throne by the swords of those who thought us
      worthy. Our high state will not escape the eye of envy. You may be sure of
      that. But there is no reason for you to feel alarm because in this
      world-wide upheaval a couple of legions have not yet settled down. I
      myself did not succeed to a safe and peaceful throne, and, when once the
      news of your adoption is spread, I shall cease to be charged with my
      advanced age, which is now the only fault they find in me. The rascals
      will always miss Nero: you and I have got to see that good citizens do not
      miss him too.
    </p>
    <p>
      'A longer sermon would ill befit the time and I have fulfilled my purpose,
      if I have done right in choosing you. The soundest and easiest criterion
      of right and wrong policy is to consider what you would have approved or
      condemned in another emperor. For Rome is not like the nations which are
      ruled by kings, <a name="1page35"></a><span class="pagenum">35</span>where
      one house is supreme and the rest are slaves. Your future subjects are men
      who cannot endure the extremes either of bondage or of freedom.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Galba spoke these words and more to the same effect in the tone of one
      creating an emperor: the rest addressed Piso as though he were emperor
      already. <a name="Ichap17" id="Ichap17"></a><span class="chapnum">17</span>He
      is said to have betrayed no sign of amazement or elation either before
      those who were then present, or later when everybody's eyes centred upon
      him. His language to his emperor and adoptive father was deeply respectful
      and he spoke modestly of himself. He made no change in his expression or
      bearing, showing himself more able than anxious to rule. A discussion then
      took place whether the adoption should be announced before the people or
      in the senate, or in the guards' camp. They decided in favour of the camp,
      on the ground that it would be a compliment to the troops, whose goodwill
      was hard to win by flattery or bribes, but was by no means to be despised,
      if it could be won by good means. Meanwhile the curiosity of the populace,
      impatient of any important secret, had brought together crowds all round
      the Palace, and when once the rumour began to leak out an attempt at
      suppression only resulted in spreading it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap18" id="Ichap18"></a><span class="chapnum">18</span>The
      tenth of January was a dreary wet day, and an extraordinary storm of
      thunder and lightning showed the displeasure of Providence. Such phenomena
      were regarded in old days as a sign for the suspension of public business,
      but they did not deter Galba from proceeding to the camp. Either he
      disregarded such <a name="1page36"></a><span class="pagenum">36</span>things
      as the result of pure chance or else he felt that the blows of fate may be
      foretold but not forestalled. He addressed a crowded assembly of the
      soldiers with true imperial brevity, stating simply that in adopting Piso
      he was following the example of the sainted Augustus, and the old military
      custom whereby each man chose <a name="1fnm44"></a>another.<a href="#1fn44"
      class="fnnum">44</a> He was afraid that by suppressing the news of the
      German rebellion he might only seem to exaggerate the danger, so he
      voluntarily declared that the Fourth and Twenty-second legions had been
      led by a few traitors into seditious murmurings but no further, and would
      soon return to their allegiance. He made no attempt to enhance his words
      either by eloquence or largess. However, the tribunes and centurions and
      those of the soldiers who stood nearest to him gave well-sounding answers.
      The rest were sorry and silent, for the war seemed to have lost them the
      largess that had always been usual even in peace. Everybody agrees that
      they could have been won over had the parsimonious old emperor made the
      least display of generosity. He was ruined by his strict old-fashioned
      inflexibility, which seems too rigorous for these degenerate days.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap19" id="Ichap19"></a><span class="chapnum">19</span>From the
      camp they proceeded to the senate, and Galba's speech to its members was
      no fuller or finer than to the soldiers. Piso spoke graciously, and there
      was no lack of support in the senate. Many wished him well. Those who did
      not were the more effusive. <a name="1page37"></a><span class="pagenum">37</span>The
      majority were indifferent, but displayed a ready affability, intent on
      their private speculations without thought of the country's good. No other
      public action is reported of Piso during the four days which intervened
      between his adoption and assassination.

      <a name="Galbas_Measures_of_Precaution" id="Galbas_Measures_of_Precaution"></a>Galba's
      Measures of Precaution
    </h3>
    <p>
      Reports of the German rebellion grew daily more insistent and the public
      was always ready to believe any news, provided it was bad. Accordingly the
      senate decided that a commission must be sent to the army in Germany. It
      was discussed in private whether Piso should go himself to add dignity to
      the commission, since he could carry the authority of the emperor, while
      the others represented the senate. It was also proposed to send Laco, the
      prefect of the Guards, but he objected. The senate had allowed Galba to
      nominate the commissioners and he showed the most miserable indecision,
      now nominating members, now excusing them, now making exchanges, yielding
      always to pressure from people who wanted to go or to stay at home
      according as they were determined by their hopes or their fears. <a
      name="Ichap20" id="Ichap20"></a><span class="chapnum">20</span>The next
      question was one of finance. After investigating all possible sources it
      seemed most reasonable to recover the revenue from those quarters where
      the cause of the deficit lay. Nero had squandered in lavish presents two
      thousand two hundred million <a name="1fnm45"></a>sesterces.<a
      href="#1fn45" class="fnnum">45</a> Galba gave instructions that these
      monies should be recovered from <a name="1page38"></a><span class="pagenum">38</span>the
      individual recipients, leaving each a tithe of their original gift.
      However, in each case there was scarcely a tenth part left, for these
      worthless spendthrifts had run through Nero's money as freely as they had
      squandered their own: they had no real property or capital left, nothing
      but the apparatus of their luxury. Thirty of the knights were entrusted
      with the duty of recovering the money. This commission, for which there
      was no precedent, proved vastly unpopular owing to the scope of its
      authority, and the large number of the victims. Every quarter seemed beset
      with sales and brokers and lawsuits. And yet lively satisfaction was
      caused by the discovery that the beneficiaries of Nero's bounty were as
      poor as the victims of his greed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time several officers were cashiered, Antonius Taurus and Antonius
      Naso of the Guards, Aemilius Pacensis of the City Garrison, and Julius
      Fronto of the <a name="1fnm46"></a>Police.<a href="#1fn46" class="fnnum">46</a>
      However, this proved no remedy. The others only began to feel alarmed,
      thinking that Galba's craft and timidity had sacrificed a few, while his
      suspicions rested on them all.

      <a name="Ichap21" id="Ichap21"></a><span class="chapnum">21</span>Meanwhile
      Otho had nothing to hope from a peaceful settlement: all his plans
      demanded a disturbance. Many motives spurred him on: his extravagance
      would have ruined a prince, and his poverty have perplexed a private
      person: he was angry with Galba and jealous <a name="1page39"></a><span
      class="pagenum">39</span>of Piso. He also alleged fears for his safety, by
      way of whetting his ambition. 'I proved a nuisance to Nero,' he would say,
      'and can scarcely expect the compliment of a second exile to Lusitania.<a
      name="1fnm47"></a><a href="#1fn47" class="fnnum">47</a> Besides, monarchs
      always hate and suspect the man who is mentioned as "next to the throne".
      This was what did me harm with the old emperor, and it will weigh still
      more with the youthful Piso, who is naturally savage and has been
      exasperated by a long period of exile. It would be easy to kill me. I must
      do and dare while Galba's authority is on the wane and Piso's not yet
      established. These times of change suit big enterprises; inaction is more
      deadly than daring; there is no call for delay. Death is the natural end
      for all alike, and the only difference is between fame and oblivion
      afterwards. Seeing that the same end awaits the innocent and the guilty, a
      man of spirit should at least deserve his fate.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap22" id="Ichap22"></a><span class="chapnum">22</span>Otho's
      character was by no means so effeminate as his person. His intimate
      freedmen and slaves, who were allowed a licence unusual in private
      households, dangled before him the baits for which he was greedy: the
      luxuries of Nero's Court, the marriages he could make, the adulteries he
      could commit, and all the other imperial pleasures. They were his, they
      pointed out, if he would bestir himself; it was shameful to lie quiet and
      leave them to others. He was also incited by the astrologers, who declared
      that their study of the stars pointed to great changes and a year <a
      name="1page40"></a><span class="pagenum">40</span>of glory for Otho.
      Creatures of this class always deceive the ambitious, though those in
      power distrust them. Probably we shall go on for ever proscribing them and
      keeping them by <a name="1fnm48"></a>us.<a href="#1fn48" class="fnnum">48</a>
      <a name="1fnm49"></a>Poppaea<a href="#1fn49" class="fnnum">49</a> had
      always had her boudoir full of these astrologers, the worst kind of outfit
      for a royal m&eacute;nage. One of them, called Ptolemy, had gone with Otho
      to <a name="1fnm50"></a>Spain<a href="#1fn50" class="fnnum">50</a> and
      foretold that he would outlive Nero. This came true and Otho believed in
      him. He now based his vague conjectures on the computations of Galba's age
      and Otho's youth, and persuaded him that he would ascend the throne. But,
      though the man had no real skill, Otho accepted the prophecy as if it was
      the finger of fate. Human nature always likes to believe what it cannot
      understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap23" id="Ichap23"></a><span class="chapnum">23</span>Nor was
      Ptolemy himself slow to incite his master to crime, to which it is only a
      short step from such ambitions. But whether his criminal designs were
      deliberate or suddenly conceived, it is impossible to say. He had long
      been courting the goodwill of the soldiers either in the hope of being
      adopted by Galba or to prepare the way for treason. On the road from
      Spain, while the men were marching or on outpost duty, he would address
      the veterans by name, reminding them how he and they had served together
      under Nero, and calling them his comrades. He renewed acquaintance <a
      name="1page41"></a><span class="pagenum">41</span>with some, asked after
      others and helped them with money or influence, frequently letting fall
      complaints and ambiguous remarks about Galba, using all the arts which
      work upon uneducated minds. The soldiers grumbled bitterly at the
      exertions of the march, the shortage of provisions, and the strict
      discipline. What they were used to was a journey to the Campanian Lakes or
      Greek seaports on board ship;<a name="1fnm51"></a><a href="#1fn51"

      <a name="Ichap24" id="Ichap24"></a><span class="chapnum">24</span>While
      the soldiers were thus already fired with discontent, Maevius Pudens, one
      of Tigellinus'<a name="1fnm52"></a><a href="#1fn52" class="fnnum">52</a>
      intimates, added fuel to their feelings by luring on all who were
      naturally unstable or in need of money, or rashly eager for a change.
      Eventually, whenever Galba dined with him, Otho went the length of
      presenting a hundred sesterces to each of the soldiers on guard, on the
      pretext that this was instead of entertaining <a name="1fnm53"></a>them.<a
      href="#1fn53" class="fnnum">53</a> This system of public largess Otho
      extended by making presents in confidence to individuals, and such spirit
      did he show in bribery that when a member of the Body Guard, Cocceius
      Proculus, brought an action to <a name="1page42"></a><span class="pagenum">42</span>claim
      part of his neighbour's farm, Otho bought the whole property out of his
      own pocket and gave it to him. He was enabled to do this by the
      inefficiency of the Prefect Laco, who was no less blind to notorious than
      to secret scandals.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap25" id="Ichap25"></a><span class="chapnum">25</span>Otho
      then put Onomastus, one of his freedmen, in charge of the projected crime,
      and Onomastus took into his confidence Barbius Proculus, an aide-de-camp,
      and a subaltern named Veturius, both in the Body <a name="1fnm54"></a>Guard.<a
      href="#1fn54" class="fnnum">54</a> Having assured himself by many
      interviews that they were both bold and cunning, Otho proceeded to load
      them with bribes and promises, providing them with funds to enable them to
      test the feelings of the others. And so a couple of common soldiers took
      it upon them to transfer the Roman Empire: and they did it. A very few
      were admitted as accomplices. These, by various devices, worked on the
      indecision of the others. The non-commissioned officers who had been
      promoted by Nymphidius felt themselves under suspicion; the private
      soldiers were indignant and in despair at the constant postponement of
      Galba's largess; some few were fired by the recollection of Nero's r&eacute;gime
      and longed for the days of licence; all in common shared the fear of being
      drafted out of the Praetorian Guards.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap26" id="Ichap26"></a><span class="chapnum">26</span>The
      infection of treason soon spread to the legions <a name="1page43"></a><span
      class="pagenum">43</span>and auxiliaries, whose excitement had been
      aroused as soon as they heard that the armies of Germany were wavering in
      their allegiance. So, as the disloyal were ready for treason and the loyal
      shut their eyes, they at first determined to acclaim Otho as he was
      returning from dinner on the night of the fourteenth. However, they
      hesitated: the darkness spelt uncertainty, the troops were scattered all
      over the town, and unanimity could scarcely be expected from drunken men.
      They were not deterred by any affection for their country's honour, which
      they were deliberately preparing to stain with its emperor's blood, but
      they were afraid that, as Otho was unknown to the majority, some one else
      might by mistake be offered to the Pannonian or German legions and
      proclaimed emperor. Some evidence of the brewing plot leaked out, but it
      was suppressed by the conspirators. Rumours even reached Galba's ears, but
      Laco made light of them, being totally ignorant of soldiers' characters,
      hostile to any suggestion, however wise, that was not his own, and
      extremely obstinate with men who knew more than he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap27" id="Ichap27"></a><span class="chapnum">27</span>On
      January 15, as Galba was sacrificing in front of the temple of Apollo, the
      priest Umbricius declared the omens unfavourable: treason was impending,
      and an enemy within the walls. Otho, who was standing beside Galba,
      overheard and construed the omen as being from his own point of view a
      good one, favourable to his plans. In a few moments his freedman,
      Onomastus, announced that the architect and contractors were waiting to
      see him. This had been agreed <a name="1page44"></a><span class="pagenum">44</span>upon
      as the signal that the troops were assembling and the conspiracy was ripe.
      On being asked where he was going, Otho pretended that he was buying an
      old property, but suspected its condition and so had to inspect it first.
      Thus, leaning on his freedman's shoulder, he passed through Tiberius'
      house into the Velabrum and thence to the Golden Milestone at the foot of
      the Temple of <a name="1fnm55"></a>Saturn.<a href="#1fn55" class="fnnum">55</a>
      There thirty-three soldiers of the Body Guard saluted him as emperor. When
      he showed alarm at the smallness of their number they put him hastily into
      a litter, and, drawing their swords, hurried him away. About the same
      number of soldiers joined them on the way, some accomplices, others merely
      curious. Some marched along shouting and flourishing swords; others kept
      silent, intending to take their cue from subsequent events.

    <p>
      <a name="Ichap28" id="Ichap28"></a><span class="chapnum">28</span>Julius
      Martialis was the tribune on duty in the camp. He was so overcome by the
      magnitude of this unexpected crime and so afraid that the treason was
      widespread in the camp, and that he might be killed if he offered any
      opposition, that he led most people to suppose he was in the plot. So,
      too, the other tribunes and centurions all preferred present safety to a
      risky loyalty. In fact the general attitude was this: few dared to
      undertake so foul a crime, many wished to see it done, and everybody was
      ready to condone it.

      <a name="The_Fall_of_Galba" id="The_Fall_of_Galba"></a>The Fall of Galba
    </h3>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap29" id="Ichap29"></a><span class="chapnum">29</span>Meanwhile
      Galba in total ignorance and intent upon his sacrifices continued to
      importune the gods of an empire that had already ceased to be his. First
      there came a rumour that some one or other of the senators was being
      hurried to the camp, then that it was Otho. Immediately people who had met
      Otho came flocking in from all quarters of Rome; some in their terror
      exaggerated the truth, some minimized it, remembering even then to
      flatter. After discussion it was decided that the temper of the cohort on
      guard in the palace should be tested, but not by Galba himself. His
      authority was held in reserve for more heroic remedies. The troops were
      summoned. Piso, standing out on the steps of the palace, addressed them as
      follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fellow soldiers, it is now five days since I was made a Caesar. I knew
      nothing of the future nor whether the name was more to be desired or
      feared. It now lies with you to decide whether or no my adoption is to
      prove a calamity for my house and for my country. In saying this, I do not
      dread disaster on my own account. I have known misfortune, and I am now
      discovering to the full that prosperity is just as dangerous. But for the
      sake of my adoptive father, of the senate, and of the whole empire, I
      deplore the thought that we may have to-day either to die or&mdash;what
      for good men is as wretched&mdash;to kill. In the recent revolution our
      comfort was that Rome was spared the sight of blood, and the transfer was
      effected <a name="1page46"></a><span class="pagenum">46</span>without
      disturbance. We thought that my adoption would be a safeguard against an
      outbreak of civil war even after Galba's death.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap30" id="Ichap30"></a><span class="chapnum">30</span>'I will
      make no claims to rank or respectability. To compare myself with Otho, I
      need not recite my virtues. His vices are all he has to be proud of. They
      ruined the empire, even when he was only playing the part of an emperor's
      friend. Why should he deserve to be emperor? For his swaggering demeanour?
      For his effeminate costume? Extravagance imposes on some people. They take
      it for liberality. They are wrong. He will know how to squander money, but
      not how to give it away. His mind is full of lechery and debauchery and
      intrigues with women. These are in his eyes the prerogatives of the
      throne. And the pleasure of his vices would be all his, the blushes of
      shame would be ours. No man has ever ruled well who won the throne by bad
      means.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The whole Roman world agreed to give Galba the title of Caesar. Galba
      with your approval gave that title to me. Even if the "country", the
      "senate", the "people", are empty terms, it is to your interest, my fellow
      soldiers, to see that it is not the rascals who create an emperor. From
      time to time one hears of the legionaries being in mutiny against their
      generals. But your good faith and your good name have stood to this day
      unimpaired. It was not you who deserted Nero: he deserted you. Are you
      going to allow less than thirty deserters and renegades to bestow the
      crown? Why! no one would tolerate their choosing <a name="1page47"></a><span
      class="pagenum">47</span>so much as a centurion or a tribune for
      themselves. Are you going to allow this precedent, and by your
      acquiescence make their crime your own? You will soon see this lawless
      spirit spreading to the troops abroad, and in time the treason will recoil
      on us and the war on you. Besides, innocence wins you as much as the
      murder of your emperor: you will get from us as large a bounty for your
      loyalty as you would from others for your crime.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap31" id="Ichap31"></a><span class="chapnum">31</span>The
      members of the Body Guard dispersed. The rest of the cohort paid some heed
      to his speech. Aimlessly, as happens in moments of confusion, they seized
      their standards, without as yet any fixed plan, and not, as was afterwards
      believed, to cloak their treachery. Marius Celsus had been dispatched to
      the picked detachments of the Illyrian army, which were quartered in the
      Vipsanian <a name="1fnm56"></a>arcade,<a href="#1fn56" class="fnnum">56</a>
      while instructions had been given to two senior <a name="1fnm57"></a>centurions,<a
      href="#1fn57" class="fnnum">57</a> Amullius Serenus and Domitius Sabinus,
      to summon the German troops from the Hall of Liberty. They distrusted the
      legion of marines, who had been alienated by Galba's <a name="1page48"></a><span
      class="pagenum">48</span>butchery of their comrades on his entry into <a
      name="1fnm58"></a>Rome.<a href="#1fn58" class="fnnum">58</a> Three
      officers of the guards, Cetrius Severus, Subrius Dexter, and Pompeius
      Longinus, also hurried to the camp in the hope that the mutiny was still
      in its early stages and might be averted by good advice before it came to
      a head. The soldiers attacked Subrius and Cetrius with threats and
      forcibly seizing Longinus disarmed him, because he had not come in virtue
      of his military rank, but simply as one of Galba's private friends; and
      for his loyalty to his master the rebels disliked him all the more. The
      marines without any hesitation joined the guards. The Illyrian <a
      name="1fnm59"></a>draft<a href="#1fn59" class="fnnum">59</a> drove Celsus
      away at the point of their javelins. The German detachments<a href="#1fn59"
      class="fnnum">59</a> wavered for some time. They were still in poor
      condition physically, and inclined to be passive. Nero had dispatched them
      as an advance-guard to Alexandria;<a name="1fnm60"></a><a href="#1fn60"
      class="fnnum">60</a> the long voyage back again had damaged their health,
      and Galba had spared no expense in looking after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap32" id="Ichap32"></a><span class="chapnum">32</span>The
      whole populace of Rome was now crowding into the palace together with a
      good sprinkling of slaves. With discordant shouts they demanded the death
      of Otho and the doom of the conspirators. They might have been in the
      circus or the theatre, clamouring for entertainment. There was neither
      sense nor sincerity in their behaviour. They were quite ready on the same
      day to clamour for the opposite with equal zeal. <a name="1page49"></a><span
      class="pagenum">49</span>But it is an established custom to flatter any
      emperor with unbridled cheering and meaningless enthusiasm. Meanwhile
      Galba was torn between two opinions. Titus Vinius maintained that they
      ought to remain within the palace, employ the slaves to offer resistance
      and block up all the doors, instead of going out to face the angry troops.
      'This will give time,' he urged, 'for the disloyal to repent and the loyal
      to unite their forces. Crimes demand haste, good counsels profit by delay.
      Besides, if need be, we shall have the same chance of leaving the palace
      later: if we leave and repent of it, it will not be in our power to
      return.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap33" id="Ichap33"></a><span class="chapnum">33</span>All the
      others voted for immediate action before the conspiracy gathered strength
      and numbers. 'Otho,' they argued, 'will soon lose heart. He crept away by
      stealth and was introduced in a litter to a parcel of strangers, and now
      because we dally and waste time he has leisure to rehearse his part of
      emperor. What is the good of waiting until Otho sets his camp in order and
      approaches the Capitol, while Galba peeps out of a window? Are this famous
      general and his gallant friends to shut the doors and not to stir a foot
      over the threshold, as if they were anxious to endure a siege? Much help
      may we hope from slaves, when once the unwieldy crowd loses its unity and
      their first indignation, which counts for so much, begins to cool. No,
      cowardice is too risky. Or if we must fall, let us meet the danger
      half-way, and cover Otho with disgrace, ourselves with honour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1page50"></a><span class="pagenum">50</span>When Vinius resisted
      this proposal, Laco, prompted by Icelus, assailed him with threats,
      persisting in his private quarrel to the ruin of his country. <a
      name="Ichap34" id="Ichap34"></a><span class="chapnum">34</span>Galba
      without further delay supported those whose plan would look best. However,
      Piso was first dispatched to the camp. The young man had a great name, his
      popularity was still fresh, and moreover, he disliked Titus Vinius, or, if
      he did not, Vinius' enemies hoped he did: it is so easy to believe in
      hatred. Scarcely had Piso departed, when there arrived a rumour that Otho
      had been killed in the camp. At first it was vague and uncertain, but
      eventually, as so often happens with daring lies, people began to assert
      that they had been present and seen the deed. Some were glad and some
      indifferent, so the news gained easy credence. Many, however, thought that
      the report had been concocted and disseminated by friends of Otho, who now
      mingled in the crowd and tried to lure Galba out by spreading this
      agreeable falsehood. <a name="Ichap35" id="Ichap35"></a><span
      class="chapnum">35</span>At this point not only the populace and the
      inexperienced mob but many of the knights and senators as well broke out
      into applause and unbridled enthusiasm. With their fear they had lost
      their caution. Breaking open the palace gates they rushed in and presented
      themselves before Galba, complaining that they had been forestalled in the
      task of revenge. All the cowards who, as events proved, could show no
      pluck in action, indulged in excessive heroics and lip-courage. Nobody
      knew, everybody talked. At last, for lack of the truth, Galba yielded to
      the consensus of error. When he had put on his <a name="1page51"></a><span
      class="pagenum">51</span>breastplate he was lifted into a chair, for he
      was too old and infirm to stand against the crowds that kept flocking in.
      In the palace he was met by Julius Atticus, of the Body Guard, who
      displayed a dripping sword and shouted out that he had killed Otho.
      'Comrade,' said Galba, 'who bade you?' Galba had a remarkable power of
      curbing soldiers' presumption, for he was not afraid of threats nor moved
      by flattery.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap36" id="Ichap36"></a><span class="chapnum">36</span>Meanwhile
      in Otho's camp there was no longer any doubt of the soldiers' unanimity.
      Such was their enthusiasm that they were not content with carrying Otho
      shoulder-high in procession; they placed him among the standards on the
      platform, where shortly before a gilt statue of Galba had stood, and made
      a ring round him with their <a name="1fnm61"></a>colours.<a href="#1fn61"
      class="fnnum">61</a> Tribunes and centurions were allowed no approach: the
      common soldiers even called out, 'Beware of the officers.' The whole camp
      resounded with confused shouts of mutual encouragement. It was quite
      unlike the wavering and spiritless flattery of a civil mob. As new
      adherents streamed in, directly a soldier caught sight of one of them, he
      grasped him by the hand, flung his arms round him, kept him at his side,
      and dictated the oath of allegiance. Some commended their general to his
      soldiers, and some the soldiers to their general. Otho, for his part, was
      not slow to greet the crowd with outstretched hand and throw kisses to
      them. In every way he played the slave to gain a throne. When <a
      name="1page52"></a><span class="pagenum">52</span>the whole legion of the
      marines had sworn allegiance, he gained confidence in his strength, and,
      considering that those whom he had incited individually needed a few words
      of general encouragement, he stood out on the rampart and began as
      follows:&mdash;<a name="Ichap37" id="Ichap37"></a><span class="chapnum">37</span>'In
      what guise I come forward to address you, Fellow Soldiers, I cannot tell.
      Dubbed emperor by you, I dare not call myself a private citizen: yet
      "emperor" I cannot say with another on the throne. And what am I to call
      you? That too will remain in doubt until it is decided whether you have
      here in your camp an enemy or an emperor of Rome. You hear how they
      clamour at once for my death and your punishment. So clear is it that we
      must fall or stand together. Doubtless Galba&mdash;such is his clemency&mdash;has
      already promised our destruction. Is he not the man who without the least
      excuse butchered thousands of utterly innocent <a name="1fnm62"></a>soldiers?<a
      href="#1fn62" class="fnnum">62</a> I shudder whenever I recall his ghastly
      entry into the city, when before the face of Rome he ordered the
      decimation of the troops whom at their humble petition he had taken under
      his protection. That is Galba's only "victory". These were the auspices
      under which he made his entry; and what glory has he brought to the throne
      he occupies, save the murder of Obultronius Sabinus and Cornelius
      Marcellus in Spain, of Betuus Cilo in Gaul, of Fonteius Capito in Germany,
      of Clodius Macer in Africa, of Cingonius on his march to Rome, of
      Turpilianus in the city, and of Nymphidius in the camp? What <a
      name="1page53"></a><span class="pagenum">53</span>province is there in the
      empire that has not been polluted with massacre? He calls it "salutary
      correction". For his "remedies" are what other people call crimes: his
      cruelty is disguised as "austerity", his avarice as "economy", while by
      "discipline" he means punishing and insulting you. It is but seven months
      since Nero's death, and already Icelus alone has embezzled more than all
      the depredations of Polyclitus and Vatinius and <a name="1fnm63"></a>Aegialus<a
      href="#1fn63" class="fnnum">63</a> put together. Why, Vinius would have
      been less greedy and lawless had he been emperor himself. As it is, he
      treats us as his own subjects and despises us as Galba's. His own fortune
      alone could provide the largess which they daily cast in your teeth but
      never pay into your pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap38" id="Ichap38"></a><span class="chapnum">38</span>'Nor in
      Galba's successor either is there any hope for you. Galba has seen to
      that. He has recalled from exile the man whose avarice and sour temper he
      judged most like his own. You witnessed for yourselves, my comrades, the
      extraordinary storm which signified Heaven's abhorrence at that
      ill-starred adoption. The Senate and People of Rome feel the same. They
      are counting on your courage. You alone can give strength to the right
      policy: it is powerless without you, however good it be. It is <a
      name="1page54"></a><span class="pagenum">54</span>not to war and danger
      that I call you. All the troops are with us. That single plain-clothes
      <a name="1fnm64"></a>cohort<a href="#1fn64" class="fnnum">64</a> is no
      longer a defence to Galba, but a hindrance. When once they have caught
      sight of you, when once they come to take their orders from me, the only
      quarrel between you will be who can do most to put me in their debt. There
      is no room for delay in plans which cannot be commended until they are put
      into action.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Otho then gave orders to open the arsenal. The soldiers immediately seized
      their arms in such haste that all the ordinary distinctions of the service
      were neglected: neither Guards nor Legionaries carried their own arms:<a
      name="1fnm65"></a><a href="#1fn65" class="fnnum">65</a> in the confusion
      they took the helmets and shields of the auxiliaries. There were no
      tribunes or centurions to encourage them: each man followed his own lead,
      and the rascals found their chief incentive in the consternation of the
      loyal. <a name="Ichap39" id="Ichap39"></a><span class="chapnum">39</span>As
      the riot increased, Piso, alarmed by the din of their shouts, which could
      be heard even in the city, had overtaken Galba, who had meanwhile left the
      palace and was approaching the Forum. Marius Celsus had also brought back
      no good news. Some were for returning to the palace, others for seeking
      the shelter of the Capitol, many for seizing the Rostra. The majority
      merely disagreed with other people's proposals, and, as so often happens
      <a name="1page55"></a><span class="pagenum">55</span>in these disasters,
      the best course always seemed the one for which it was now too late. It is
      said that Laco, without Galba's knowledge, proposed the assassination of
      Titus Vinius, either with the idea that his execution would be a sop to
      the soldiers, or because he believed him Otho's accomplice, or, as a last
      alternative, hatred may have been his motive. However, the time and the
      place both bred scruples; when killing once begins it is difficult to set
      a limit: besides, their plans were upset by the arrival of terrified
      messengers, by the continual desertion of their supporters, and by a
      general waning of enthusiasm even among those who at first had been the
      keenest to display their loyalty and courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap40" id="Ichap40"></a><span class="chapnum">40</span>Galba
      was driven hither and thither by the tide of the surging mob. The temples
      and public <a name="1fnm66"></a>buildings<a href="#1fn66" class="fnnum">66</a>
      were crowded with spectators, who viewed a sorry scene. No shouts came
      from the crowd: astonishment was on their faces, and their ears open to
      every sound. There was neither uproar nor quiet, but the silence of strong
      emotion and alarm. However, a report reached Otho that the populace was
      arming. He bade his men fly headlong to forestall the danger. Off went the
      Roman soldiers as if they were going to drag Vologaesus or Pacorus from
      the ancestral throne of the <a name="1fnm67"></a>Arsacids<a href="#1fn67"
      class="fnnum">67</a>&mdash;and not to butcher their own emperor, <a
      name="1page56"></a><span class="pagenum">56</span>a helpless old man.
      Armed to the teeth, they broke at a full gallop into the Forum, scattering
      the populace and trampling senators under foot. Neither the sight of the
      Capitol nor the sanctity of the temples towering above them, nor the
      thought of Roman emperors past and to come, could avail to deter them from
      committing that crime which the next successor always avenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap41" id="Ichap41"></a><span class="chapnum">41</span>Seeing
      the armed ranks now close at hand, the standard-bearer of the cohort on
      guard over <a name="1fnm68"></a>Galba<a href="#1fn68" class="fnnum">68</a>&mdash;tradition
      says his name was Atilius Vergilio&mdash;tore off the medallion of <a
      name="1fnm69"></a>Galba<a href="#1fn69" class="fnnum">69</a> and flung it
      to the ground. This signal clearly showed that all the troops were for
      Otho: the people fled from the deserted Forum and swords were drawn
      against any who lingered. Near 'Lake Curtius'<a name="1fnm70"></a><a
      href="#1fn70" class="fnnum">70</a> Galba was precipitated from his chair
      by the panic-stricken haste of the bearers and flung to the ground. The
      accounts of his last words vary according as they are prompted by hatred
      or admiration. Some say that he whined and asked what harm he had
      deserved, begging for a few days' respite to pay the troops their largess.
      The majority say that he offered his neck to the blow and bade them,
      'Come, strike, if it serves the country's need.' Whatever he said mattered
      little to his assassins. As to the actual <a name="1page57"></a><span
      class="pagenum">57</span>murderer there is a difference of opinion. Some
      say it was Terentius, a <a name="1fnm71"></a>reservist,<a href="#1fn71"
      class="fnnum">71</a> others that his name was Laecanius. The most common
      account is that a soldier of the Fifteenth legion, by name Camurius,
      pierced his throat with a sword-thrust. The others foully mangled his arms
      and legs (his breast was covered) and with bestial savagery continued to
      stab the headless corpse. <a name="Ichap42" id="Ichap42"></a><span
      class="chapnum">42</span>Then they made for Titus Vinius. Here, too, there
      is a doubt whether the fear of imminent death strangled his voice, or
      whether he called out that they had no mandate from Otho to kill him. He
      may have invented this in his terror, or it may have been a confession of
      his complicity in the plot. His whole life and reputation give reason to
      suppose that he was an accomplice in the crime of which he was the cause.
      He was brought to the ground in front of the temple of Julius by a blow on
      the knee, and afterwards a common soldier named Julius Carus ran him
      through with a sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap43" id="Ichap43"></a><span class="chapnum">43</span>However,
      Rome found one hero that day. This was Sempronius Densus, a centurion of
      the Guards, who had been told off by Galba to protect Piso. Drawing his
      dagger he faced the armed assassins, flinging their treason in their
      teeth, and by his shouts and gestures turned their attention upon himself,
      thus enabling <a name="1page58"></a><span class="pagenum">58</span>Piso to
      escape despite his wounds. Piso, reaching the temple of Vesta, was
      mercifully sheltered by the verger, who hid him in his lodging. There, no
      reverence for this sanctuary but merely his concealment postponed his
      immediate death. Eventually, Otho, who was burning to have him <a
      name="1fnm72"></a>killed,<a href="#1fn72" class="fnnum">72</a> dispatched
      as special agents, Sulpicius Florus of the British cohorts, a man whom
      Galba had recently enfranchised, and Statius Murcus of the Body Guard.
      They dragged Piso forth and butchered him on the threshold of the temple.

    </h3>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap44" id="Ichap44"></a><span class="chapnum">44</span>None of
      his murders pleased Otho so much as this. On Piso's head, as on no other,
      they say, he gazed with insatiable eyes. This was possibly the first
      moment at which he felt relieved of all anxiety, and free to indulge his
      glee; or perhaps, in the case of Galba and of Vinius, the recollection of
      his treason to the one and of his former friendship with the other
      troubled even his unfeeling heart with gloomy thoughts, whereas, Piso
      being an enemy and a rival, he considered it a pious duty to gloat over
      his murder. Their heads were fixed on poles and carried along with the
      standards of the cohorts side by side with the eagle of the <a
      name="1fnm73"></a>legion.<a href="#1fn73" class="fnnum">73</a> Those who
      had done the deed and those who had witnessed it vied with each other in
      displaying their bloody hands, all boasting of their share&mdash;some
      falsely, <a name="1page59"></a><span class="pagenum">59</span>some truly&mdash;as
      if it were a fine and memorable exploit. Vitellius subsequently discovered
      more than 120 petitions demanding rewards for distinguished services
      rendered on that day. He gave orders to search out all the petitioners and
      put them to death. This was from no respect for Galba: he merely followed
      the traditional custom by which princes secure their present safety and
      posthumous vengeance.

    <p>
      <a name="Ichap45" id="Ichap45"></a><span class="chapnum">45</span>The
      senate and people seemed different men. There was a general rush for the
      camp, every one shouldering his neighbour and trying to overtake those in
      front. They heaped insults on Galba, praised the prudence of the troops,
      and covered Otho's hand with kisses, their extravagance varying inversely
      with their sincerity. Otho rebuffed no one, and succeeded by his words and
      looks in moderating the menace of the soldiers' greed for vengeance. They
      loudly demanded the execution of Marius Celsus, the consul-elect, who had
      remained Galba's faithful friend to the last. They were as much offended
      at his efficiency and honesty as if these had been criminal qualities.
      What they wanted was obviously to find a first excuse for plunder and
      murder and the destruction of all decent citizens. But Otho had as yet no
      influence to prevent crimes: he could only order them. So he simulated
      anger, giving instructions for Celsus' arrest, and by promising that he
      should meet with a worse penalty, thus rescued him from immediate death.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap46" id="Ichap46"></a><span class="chapnum">46</span>The will
      of the soldiers was now henceforward supreme. The Praetorian Guards chose
      their own <a name="1page60"></a><span class="pagenum">60</span>prefects,
      Plotius Firmus, a man who had risen from the ranks to the post of Chief of
      <a name="1fnm74"></a>Police,<a href="#1fn74" class="fnnum">74</a> and
      joined Otho's side before Galba's fall, and Licinius Proculus, an intimate
      friend of Otho, and therefore suspected of furthering his plans. They made
      Flavius <a name="1fnm75"></a>Sabinus<a href="#1fn75" class="fnnum">75</a>
      prefect of the city, therein following Nero's choice, under whom Sabinus
      had held that post; besides, most of them had an eye to the fact that he
      was Vespasian's brother. An urgent demand arose that the customary fees to
      centurions for granting furlough should be abolished, for they constituted
      a sort of annual tax upon the common soldier. The result had been that a
      quarter of each company could go off on leave or lounge idly about the
      barracks, so long as they paid the centurion his fee, nor was there any
      one to control either the amount of this impost or the means by which the
      soldiers raised the money: highway robbery or menial service was the usual
      resort whereby they purchased leisure. Then, again, a soldier who had
      money was savagely burdened with work until he should buy exemption. Thus
      he soon became impoverished and enervated by idleness, and returned to his
      company no longer a man of means and energy but penniless and lazy. So the
      process went on. One after another they became deteriorated by poverty and
      lax discipline, rushing blindly into quarrels and <a name="1page61"></a><span
      class="pagenum">61</span>mutiny, and, as a last resource, into civil war.
      Otho was afraid of alienating the centurions by his concessions to the
      rank and file, and promised to pay the annual furlough-fees out of his
      private purse. This was indubitably a sound reform, which good emperors
      have since established as a regular custom in the army. The prefect Laco
      he pretended to banish to an island, but on his arrival he was stabbed by
      a <a name="1fnm76"></a>reservist<a href="#1fn76" class="fnnum">76</a> whom
      Otho had previously dispatched for that purpose. Marcianus Icelus, as
      being one of his own freedmen,<a name="1fnm77"></a><a href="#1fn77"
      class="fnnum">77</a> he sentenced to public execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap47" id="Ichap47"></a><span class="chapnum">47</span>Thus the
      day was spent in crimes, and worst of all was the joy they caused. The
      senate was summoned by the urban <a name="1fnm78"></a>praetor.<a
      href="#1fn78" class="fnnum">78</a> The other magistrates all vied in
      flattery. The senators arrived post-haste. They decreed to Otho the powers
      of the tribunate, the title of Augustus, and all the imperial
      prerogatives. Their unanimous object was to blot out all recollection of
      former insults; but, as these had been hurled equally from all sides, they
      did not, as far as any one could see, stick in his memory. Whether he had
      forgotten them or only postponed punishment, his reign was too short to
      show. He was then carried through the still reeking Forum among the piles
      of dead bodies to the Capitol, and thence to the palace. He granted
      permission to burn and bury the bodies of his victims. <a name="1page62"></a><span
      class="pagenum">62</span>Piso's wife Verania and his brother Scribonianus
      laid out his body, and this was done for Vinius by his daughter Crispina.
      They had to search for the heads and buy them back from the murderers, who
      had preserved them for sale.

      only advantage he reaped was to be killed first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Titus Vinius in his fifty-seven years had displayed strange contrasts of
      character. His father belonged to a family of praetorian rank; his
      mother's father was one of the <a name="1fnm81"></a>proscribed.<a
      href="#1fn81" class="fnnum">81</a> A scandal marked his first military
      service under the general Calvisius <a name="1fnm82"></a>Sabinus.<a
      href="#1fn82" class="fnnum">82</a> The general's wife suffered from a
      suspicious desire to inspect the arrangements of the camp, which she
      entered by night disguised in soldier's uniform. There she brazenly
      interfered with the guard and the soldiers on duty, and eventually had the
      effrontery <a name="1page63"></a><span class="pagenum">63</span>to commit
      adultery in the general's own quarters. The man convicted of implication
      in this scandal was Titus Vinius. He was therefore put in irons by order
      of <a name="1fnm83"></a>Caligula.<a href="#1fn83" class="fnnum">83</a>
      However, the fortunes of the time soon changed and he was set at liberty.
      After mounting the ladder of office without check, he was as an ex-praetor
      given the command of a legion, and proved successful. But soon again he
      soiled his reputation, and laid himself under the charge of having been
      mean enough to steal a gold cup from Claudius' dinner-table. Claudius gave
      orders that on the next day Vinius alone of all his guests should be
      served on earthenware. However, as pro-consul, Vinius' government of
      Narbonese Gaul was strict and honest. Subsequently his friendship with
      Galba brought him into danger. He was bold, cunning, and efficient, with
      great power for good or for evil, according to his mood. Vinius' will was
      annulled because of his great wealth. Piso was poor, so his last wishes
      were respected.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap49" id="Ichap49"></a><span class="chapnum">49</span>Galba's
      body lay long neglected, and under cover of darkness was subjected to
      various insults. Eventually his steward Argius, one of his former slaves,
      gave it a humble burial in his private garden. His head, which the
      camp-followers and servants had mangled and carried on a pole, was found
      next day in front of the tomb of Patrobius (one of Nero's freedmen whom
      Galba had executed) and buried with the body which had already been
      cremated. Such was the end of <a name="1page64"></a><span class="pagenum">64</span>Servius
      Galba, who for seventy-three years had enjoyed prosperity under five
      different emperors, happier in their reign than his own. He came of an old
      and noble family and possessed great wealth. His own character was
      mediocre, rather free from vices than rich in virtues. Though not
      indifferent to fame, he did not court it by advertisement. Not greedy of
      other people's money, he was careful of his own, and a miser with public
      funds. His attitude towards friends and freedmen, if they were honest, was
      one of kindly complaisance; when they were not, he was culpably blind. But
      his distinguished origin and the peculiar perils of the time disguised his
      apathy, which passed as <a name="1fnm84"></a>prudence.<a href="#1fn84"
      class="fnnum">84</a> In the flower of his youth he served with distinction
      in Germany. As pro-consul he governed Africa wisely, and in later years
      showed the same equity in Nearer Spain.<a name="1fnm85"></a><a
      href="#1fn85" class="fnnum">85</a> When he was a commoner he seemed too
      big for his station, and had he never been emperor, no one would have
      doubted his ability to reign.

      <a name="The_Rise_of_Vitellius" id="The_Rise_of_Vitellius"></a>The Rise of
      Vitellius
    </h3>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap50" id="Ichap50"></a><span class="chapnum">50</span>The city
      was in a panic. The alarm aroused by the recent atrocious crime and by
      Otho's well-known proclivities was further increased by the fresh news
      <a name="1page65"></a><span class="pagenum">65</span>about <a name="1fnm86"></a>Vitellius.<a
      href="#1fn86" class="fnnum">86</a> This news had been suppressed before
      Galba's murder, and it was believed that only the army of Upper Germany
      had revolted. Now when they saw that the two men in the world who were
      most notorious for immorality, indolence, and extravagance had been, as it
      were, appointed by Providence to ruin the empire, not only the senators
      and knights who had some stake and interest in the country, but the masses
      as well, openly deplored their fate. Their talk was no longer of the
      horrors of the recent bloody peace: they reverted to the records of the
      civil wars, the taking and retaking of Rome by her own troops, the
      devastation of Italy, the pillage of the provinces, the battles of
      Pharsalia, Philippi, Perusia, and <a name="1fnm87"></a>Mutina,<a
      href="#1fn87" class="fnnum">87</a> those bywords of national disaster.
      'The world was turned upside down,' they mused, 'even when good men fought
      for the throne: yet the Roman Empire survived the victories of Julius
      Caesar and of Augustus, as the Republic would have survived had Pompey and
      Brutus been victorious. But now&mdash;are we to go and pray for Otho or
      for Vitellius? To pray for either would be impious. It would be wicked to
      offer vows for the success of either in a war of which we can only be sure
      that the winner will prove the worse.' Some cherished hopes of Vespasian
      and the armies of the <a name="1page66"></a><span class="pagenum">66</span>East:
      he was preferable to either of the others; still they shuddered at the
      thought of a fresh war and fresh bloodshed. Besides, Vespasian's
      reputation was doubtful. He was the first emperor who ever changed for the
      better.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap51" id="Ichap51"></a><span class="chapnum">51</span>I must
      now explain the origin and causes of the rising of Vitellius. After the
      slaughter of Julius <a name="1fnm88"></a><a href="#1fn88" class="fnnum">88</a>
      and his whole force, the troops were in high spirits at the fame and booty
      they had acquired. Without toil or danger they had won a most profitable
      victory. So they were all for marching against the enemy: plunder seemed
      better than pay. They had endured a long and unprofitable service,
      rendered the more irksome by the country and climate and by the strict
      discipline observed. But discipline, however stern in time of peace, is
      always relaxed in civil wars, when temptation stands on either hand and
      treachery goes unpunished. Men, armour, and horses they had in abundance
      for use and for show. But, whereas before the war the soldiers only knew
      the men of their own company or troop, and the provincial <a name="1fnm89"></a>frontier<a
      href="#1fn89" class="fnnum">89</a> separated the armies, now, having once
      joined forces against , they had gained a knowledge of their own strength
      and the state of the province, and were looking for more fighting and
      fresh quarrels, calling the Gauls no longer allies, as before, but 'our
      enemies' or 'the vanquished'. They had also the support of the Gallic
      tribes on the banks of the Rhine, who had <a name="1page67"></a><span
      class="pagenum">67</span>espoused their cause and were now the most eager
      to rouse them against 'the Galbians'<a name="1fnm90"></a><a href="#1fn90"
      class="fnnum">90</a> as they now called them, despising the name of . So,
      cherishing hostility against the Sequani and <a name="1fnm91"></a>Aedui,<a
      href="#1fn91" class="fnnum">91</a> and against all the other communities
      in proportion to their wealth, they drank in dreams of sacking towns and
      pillaging fields and looting houses, inspired partly by the peculiar
      failings of the strong, greed and vanity, and partly also by a feeling of
      irritation at the insolence of the Gauls, who boasted, to the chagrin of
      the army, that Galba had remitted a quarter of their tribute and given the
      franchise and grants of land to their <a name="1fnm92"></a>community.<a
      href="#1fn92" class="fnnum">92</a> Further fuel was added by a rumour,
      cunningly circulated and rashly credited, that there was a project on foot
      to decimate the legions and discharge all the most enterprising
      centurions. From every side came alarming news and sinister reports from
      the city. The colony of <a name="1fnm93"></a>Lugdunum<a href="#1fn93"
      class="fnnum">93</a> was up in arms, and its stubborn attachment to Nero
      made it a hotbed of rumour. But in the camp itself the passions and fears
      of the soldiers, and, when once they had realized their strength, their
      feeling of security, furnished the richest material for lies and won them
      easy credence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap52" id="Ichap52"></a><span class="chapnum">52</span>In the
      preceding <a name="1fnm94"></a>year,<a href="#1fn94" class="fnnum">94</a>
      shortly after the beginning of December, Aulus Vitellius had entered the
      province <a name="1page68"></a><span class="pagenum">68</span>of Lower
      Germany and held a careful inspection of the winter quarters of the
      legions. He restored many to their rank, remitted degrading penalties, and
      relieved those who had suffered disgrace, acting mainly from ambitious
      motives, but partly also upon sound judgement. Amongst other things he
      showed impartiality in remedying the injustices due to the mean and
      dishonest way in which Fonteius Capito had issued promotions and
      reductions. The soldiers did not judge Vitellius' actions as those of a
      mere ex-consul: they took him for something more, and, while serious
      critics found him <a name="1fnm95"></a>undignified,<a href="#1fn95"
      class="fnnum">95</a> his supporters spoke of his affability and
      beneficence, because he showed neither moderation nor judgement in making
      presents out of his own money and squandering other people's. Besides,
      they were so greedy for power that they took even his vices for virtues.
      In both armies there were plenty of quiet, law-abiding men as well as many
      who were unprincipled and disorderly. But for sheer reckless cupidity none
      could match two of the legionary legates, Alienus Caecina and Fabius <a
      name="1fnm96"></a>Valens.<a href="#1fn96" class="fnnum">96</a> Valens was
      hostile to Galba, because, after unmasking Verginius's <a name="1fnm97"></a>hesitation<a
      href="#1fn97" class="fnnum">97</a> and thwarting Capito's designs, he
      considered that he had been treated with ingratitude: so he incited <a
      name="1page69"></a><span class="pagenum">69</span>Vitellius by pointing
      out to him the enthusiasm of the troops. 'You,' he would say to him, 'are
      famous everywhere, and you need find no obstacle in Hordeonius <a
      name="1fnm98"></a>Flaccus.<a href="#1fn98" class="fnnum">98</a> Britain
      will join and the German auxiliaries will flock to your standard. Galba
      cannot trust the provinces; the poor old man holds the empire on
      sufferance; the transfer can be soon effected, if only you will clap on
      full sail and meet your good fortune half-way. Verginius was quite right
      to hesitate. He came of a family of knights, and his father was a nobody.
      He would have failed, had he accepted the empire: his refusal saved him.
      Your father was thrice consul, and he was censor with an emperor for his
      <a name="1fnm99"></a>colleague.<a href="#1fn99" class="fnnum">99</a> That
      gives you imperial dignity to start with, and makes it unsafe for you to
      remain a private citizen.'
    </p>
    <p>
      These promptings stirred Vitellius' sluggish nature to form desires, but
      hardly hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap53" id="Ichap53"></a><span class="chapnum">53</span>Caecina,
      on the other hand, in Upper Germany, was a handsome youth, whose big
      build, imperious spirit, clever tongue, and upright carriage had
      completely won the hearts of the soldiers. While quaestor in <a
      name="1fnm100"></a>Baetica<a href="#1fn100" class="fnnum">100</a> he had
      promptly joined Galba's party, and in spite of his youth had been given
      command of a legion. Later he was convicted of misappropriating public
      funds, and, on Galba's orders, prosecuted for <a name="1page70"></a><span
      class="pagenum">70</span>peculation. Highly indignant, Caecina determined
      to embroil the world and bury his own disgrace in the ruins of his
      country. Nor were the seeds of dissension lacking in the army. The entire
      force had taken part in the war against , nor was it until after Nero's
      death that they joined Galba's side, and even then they had been
      forestalled in swearing allegiance by the detachments of Lower Germany.
      Then again the Treviri and <a name="1fnm101"></a>Lingones<a href="#1fn101"
      class="fnnum">101</a> and the other communities which Galba had punished
      by issuing harsh edicts and confiscating part of their territory, were in
      close communication with the winter quarters of the legions. They began to
      talk treason: the soldiers degenerated in civilian society: it only wanted
      some one to avail himself of the offer they had made to Verginius.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap54" id="Ichap54"></a><span class="chapnum">54</span>Following
      an ancient custom, the tribe of the Lingones had made a present of a pair
      of silver <a name="1fnm102"></a>hands<a href="#1fn102" class="fnnum">102</a>
      to the legions as a symbol of hospitality. Assuming an appearance of
      squalid misery, their envoys made the round of the officers' quarters and
      the soldiers' tents complaining of their own wrongs and of the rewards
      lavished on neighbouring tribes. Finding the soldiers ready to listen,
      they made inflammatory allusions to the army itself, its dangers and
      humiliation. Mutiny was almost ripe, when Hordeonius Flaccus ordered the
      envoys to withdraw, and, in order to secure the secrecy of their
      departure, gave instructions to them to leave the camp <a name="1page71"></a><span
      class="pagenum">71</span>by night. This gave rise to an alarming rumour.
      Many declared that the envoys had been killed, and that, if they did not
      look out for themselves, the leading spirits among the soldiers, who had
      complained of the present state of things, would be murdered in the dark,
      while their comrades knew nothing about it. So the legions formed a secret
      compact. The auxiliaries were also taken into the plot, although at first
      they had been distrusted, because their infantry and cavalry had been
      posted in camp all round the legion's quarters as though an attack on them
      were meditated. However, they soon showed themselves the keener
      conspirators. Disloyalty is a better bond for war than it ever proves in
      peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap55" id="Ichap55"></a><span class="chapnum">55</span>In Lower
      Germany, however, the legions on the first of January swore the usual oath
      of allegiance to Galba, though with much hesitation. Few voices were heard
      even in the front ranks; the rest were silent, each waiting for his
      neighbour to take some bold step. Human nature is always ready to follow
      where it hates to lead. However, the feelings of the legions varied. The
      First and <a name="1fnm103"></a>Fifth<a href="#1fn103" class="fnnum">103</a>
      were already mutinous enough to throw a few stones at Galba's statue. The
      Fifteenth and <a name="1fnm104"></a>Sixteenth<a href="#1fn104"
      class="fnnum">104</a> dared not venture beyond muttered threats, but they
      were watching to see the outbreak begin. In Upper Germany, on the other
      hand, on the very same day, the Fourth and the Twenty-second legions, who
      were quartered together,<a name="1fnm105"></a><a href="#1fn105"
      class="fnnum">105</a> smashed their <a name="1page72"></a><span
      class="pagenum">72</span>statues of Galba to atoms. The Fourth took the
      lead, the Twenty-second at first holding back, but eventually making
      common cause with them. They did not want it to be thought that they were
      shaking off their allegiance to the empire, so in taking the oath they
      invoked the long obsolete names of the Senate and People of Rome. None of
      the officers made any movement for Galba, and indeed some of them, as
      happens in such outbreaks, headed the rebellion. However, nobody made any
      kind of set speech or mounted the platform, for there was no one as yet
      with whom to curry favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap56" id="Ichap56"></a><span class="chapnum">56</span>The
      ex-consul Hordeonius Flaccus stood by and watched their treachery. He had
      not the courage to check the storm or even to rally the waverers and
      encourage the faithful. Sluggish and cowardly, it was mere indolence that
      kept him loyal. Four centurions of the Twenty-second legion, Nonius
      Receptus, Donatius Valens, Romilius Marcellus, and Calpurnius Repentinus,
      who tried to protect Galba's statues, were swept away by the rush of the
      soldiers and put under arrest. No one retained any respect for their
      former oath of allegiance, or even remembered it; and, as happens in
      mutinies, they were all on the side of the majority.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the night of the first of January a standard-bearer of the Fourth
      legion came to <a name="1fnm106"></a>Cologne,<a href="#1fn106"
      class="fnnum">106</a> and brought the news to Vitellius at his dinner that
      the <a name="1page73"></a><span class="pagenum">73</span>Fourth and
      Twenty-second legions had broken down Galba's statues and sworn allegiance
      to the Senate and People of Rome. As this oath was meaningless, it seemed
      best to seize the critical moment and offer them an emperor. Vitellius
      dispatched messengers to inform his own troops and generals that the army
      of the Upper Province had revolted from Galba; so they must either make
      war on the rebels immediately, or, if they preferred peace and unity, make
      an emperor for themselves; and there was less danger, he reminded them, in
      choosing an emperor than in looking for one.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap57" id="Ichap57"></a><span class="chapnum">57</span>The
      quarters of the First legion were nearest at hand, and Fabius Valens was
      the most enterprising of the generals. On the following day he entered
      Cologne with the cavalry of his legion and auxiliaries, and saluted
      Vitellius as emperor. The other legions of the province followed suit,
      vying with each other in enthusiasm; and the army of the Upper Province,
      dropping the fine-sounding titles of the Senate and People of Rome, joined
      Vitellius on the third of January, which clearly showed that on the two
      previous days they were not really at the disposal of a republican
      government. The inhabitants of Cologne and the Treviri and Lingones,
      rivalling the zeal of the troops, made offers of assistance, or of horses
      or arms or money, each according to the measure of their strength, wealth,
      <a name="1page74"></a><span class="pagenum">74</span>or enterprise. And
      these offers came not only from the civil and military authorities, men
      who had plenty of money to spare and much to hope from victory, but whole
      companies or individual soldiers handed over their savings, or, instead of
      money, their belts, or the silver <a name="1fnm107"></a>ornaments<a
      href="#1fn107" class="fnnum">107</a> on their uniforms, some carried away
      by a wave of enthusiasm, some acting from motives of self-interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap58" id="Ichap58"></a><span class="chapnum">58</span>Vitellius
      accordingly commended the zeal of the troops. He distributed among Roman
      knights the court-offices which had been usually held by <a name="1fnm108"></a>freedmen,<a
      href="#1fn108" class="fnnum">108</a> paid the centurions their
      furlough-fees out of the imperial <a name="1fnm109"></a>purse,<a
      href="#1fn109" class="fnnum">109</a> and for the most part conceded the
      soldiers' savage demands for one execution after another, though he
      occasionally cheated them by pretending to imprison their victims. Thus
      Pompeius <a name="1fnm110"></a>Propinquus,<a href="#1fn110" class="fnnum">110</a>
      the imperial agent in Belgica, was promptly executed, while Julius Burdo,
      who commanded the fleet on the Rhine, was adroitly rescued. The
      indignation of the army had broken out against him, because he was
      supposed to have intrigued against Fonteius Capito, and to have accused
      him <a name="1fnm111"></a>falsely.<a href="#1fn111" class="fnnum">111</a>
      Capito's memory was dear to the army, and when <a name="1page75"></a><span
      class="pagenum">75</span>violence reigns murder may show its face, but
      pardon must be stealthy. So Burdo was kept in confinement and only
      released after victory had allayed the soldiers' rancour. Meanwhile a
      centurion, named Crispinus, was offered as a scape-goat. He had actually
      stained his hands with Capito's blood, so his guilt seemed more obvious to
      those who clamoured for his punishment, and Vitellius felt he was a
      cheaper sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap59" id="Ichap59"></a><span class="chapnum">59</span>Julius
      <a name="1fnm112"></a>Civilis<a href="#1fn112" class="fnnum">112</a> was
      the next to be rescued from danger. He was all-powerful among the <a
      name="1fnm113"></a>Batavi,<a href="#1fn113" class="fnnum">113</a> and
      Vitellius did not want to alienate so spirited a people by punishing him.
      Besides, eight cohorts of Batavian troops were stationed among the
      Lingones. They had been an auxiliary force attached to the Fourteenth, and
      in the general disturbance had deserted the legion. Their decision for one
      side or the other would be of the first importance. Nonius, Donatius,
      Romilius, and Calpurnius, the centurions mentioned above,<a name="1fnm114"></a><a
      href="#1fn114" class="fnnum">114</a> were executed by order of Vitellius.
      They had been convicted of loyalty, a heinous offence among deserters. His
      party soon gained the accession of Valerius Asiaticus, governor of
      Belgica, who subsequently married Vitellius' daughter, and of Junius
      Blaesus,<a name="1fnm115"></a><a href="#1fn115" class="fnnum">115</a>
      governor of the Lyons division of Gaul, who <a name="1page76"></a><span
      class="pagenum">76</span>brought with him the Italian <a name="1fnm116"></a>legion<a
      href="#1fn116" class="fnnum">116</a> and a regiment of cavalry known as
      'Taurus' Horse',<a name="1fnm117"></a><a href="#1fn117" class="fnnum">117</a>
      which had been quartered at Lugdunum. The forces in Raetia lost no time in
      joining his standard, and even the troops in Britain showed no hesitation.
      <a name="Ichap60" id="Ichap60"></a><span class="chapnum">60</span>Trebellius
      Maximus, the governor of Britain, had earned by his meanness and cupidity
      the contempt and hatred of the <a name="1fnm118"></a>army,<a href="#1fn118"
      class="fnnum">118</a> which was further inflamed by the action of his old
      enemy Roscius Coelius, who commanded the Twentieth legion, and they now
      seized the opportunity of the civil war to break out into a fierce
      quarrel. Trebellius blamed Coelius for the mutinous temper and
      insubordination of the army: Coelius complained that Trebellius had robbed
      his men and impaired their efficiency. Meanwhile their unseemly quarrel
      ruined the discipline of the forces, whose insubordination soon came to a
      head. The auxiliary horse and foot joined in the attacks on the governor,
      and rallied round Coelius. Trebellius, thus hunted out and abandoned, took
      refuge with Vitellius. The province remained quiet, despite the removal of
      the ex-consul. The government was carried on by the commanding officers of
      the legions, who were equal in authority, though Coelius' audacity gave
      him an advantage over the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap61" id="Ichap61"></a><span class="chapnum">61</span>Thus
      reinforced by the army from <a name="1fnm119"></a>Britain,<a href="#1fn119"
      class="fnnum">119</a> Vitellius, <a name="1page77"></a><span
      class="pagenum">77</span>who now had an immense force and vast resources
      at his disposal, decided on an invasion by two routes under two separate
      generals. Fabius Valens was to lure the Gauls to his standard, or, if they
      refused, to devastate their country, and then invade Italy by way of the
      Cottian <a name="1fnm120"></a>Alps.<a href="#1fn120" class="fnnum">120</a>
      Caecina was to follow the shorter route and descend into Italy over the
      Pennine <a name="1fnm121"></a>Pass.<a href="#1fn121" class="fnnum">121</a>
      Valens' column comprised the Fifth legion with its 'eagle',<a
      name="1fnm122"></a><a href="#1fn122" class="fnnum">122</a> and some picked
      detachments from the army of Lower Germany, together with auxiliary horse
      and foot, amounting in all to 40,000 men. Caecina's troops from Upper
      Germany numbered 30,000, their main strength consisting in the
      Twenty-first <a name="1fnm123"></a>legion.<a href="#1fn123" class="fnnum">123</a>
      Both columns were reinforced by German auxiliaries, whom Vitellius also
      recruited to fill up his own army, intending to follow with the main force
      of the attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap62" id="Ichap62"></a><span class="chapnum">62</span>Strange
      was the contrast between Vitellius and his army. The soldiers were all
      eagerness, clamouring for battle at once, while Gaul was still frightened
      and Spain still undecided. Winter was no obstacle to them; peace and delay
      were for cowards: they must invade Italy and seize Rome: haste was the
      safest course in civil war, where action is better than deliberation.
      Vitellius was dully apathetic, anticipating <a name="1page78"></a><span
      class="pagenum">78</span>his high station by indulging in idle luxury and
      lavish entertainments. At midday he would be drunk and drowsy with
      over-eating. However, such was the zeal of the soldiers that they even did
      the general's duties, and behaved exactly as if he had been present to
      encourage the alert and threaten the laggards. They promptly fell in and
      began to clamour for the signal to start. The title of Germanicus was then
      and there conferred on Vitellius: Caesar he would never be called, even
      after his victory.

      <a name="The_March_of_Valens_Column" id="The_March_of_Valens_Column"></a>The
      March of Valens' Column
    </h3>
    <p>
      On the very day of departure a happy omen greeted Fabius Valens and the
      army under his command. As the column advanced, an eagle flew steadily
      ahead and seemed to lead the way. Loudly though the soldiers cheered, hour
      after hour the bird flew undismayed, and was taken for a sure omen of
      success.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap63" id="Ichap63"></a><span class="chapnum">63</span>They
      passed peaceably through the country of the Treviri, who were allies. At
      <a name="1fnm124"></a>Divodurum,<a href="#1fn124" class="fnnum">124</a>
      the chief town of the Mediomatrici, although they were welcomed with all
      courtesy, the troops fell into a sudden panic. Hastily seizing their arms,
      they began to massacre the innocent citizens. Their object was not
      plunder. They were seized by a mad frenzy, which was the harder to allay
      as its cause was a mystery. Eventually the general's entreaties prevailed,
      and they refrained from destroying the town. However, nearly <a
      name="1page79"></a><span class="pagenum">79</span>4,000 men had already
      been killed. This spread such alarm throughout Gaul, that, as the army
      approached, whole towns flocked out with their magistrates at their head
      and prayers for mercy in their mouths. Women and boys prostrated
      themselves along the roads, and they resorted to every possible means by
      which an enemy's anger may be <a name="1fnm125"></a>appeased,<a
      href="#1fn125" class="fnnum">125</a> petitioning for peace, though war
      there was none.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap64" id="Ichap64"></a><span class="chapnum">64</span>It was
      in the country of the <a name="1fnm126"></a>Leuci<a href="#1fn126"
      class="fnnum">126</a> that Valens heard the news of Galba's murder and
      Otho's elevation. The soldiers showed no emotion, neither joy nor fear:
      their thoughts were all for war. The Gauls' doubts were now decided. They
      hated Otho and Vitellius equally, but Vitellius they also feared. They
      next reached the Lingones, faithful adherents of their party. There the
      courtesy of the citizens was only equalled by the good behaviour of the
      troops. But this did not last for long, thanks to the disorderly conduct
      of the Batavian auxiliaries, who, as narrated <a name="1fnm127"></a>above,<a
      href="#1fn127" class="fnnum">127</a> had detached themselves from the
      Fourteenth legion and been drafted into Valens' column. A quarrel between
      some Batavians and legionaries led to blows: the other soldiers quickly
      took sides, and a fierce battle would have ensued, had not Valens punished
      a few of the Batavians to remind them of the discipline they seemed to
      have forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1page80"></a><span class="pagenum">80</span>

    <p>
      Coming to the <a name="1fnm128"></a>Aedui,<a href="#1fn128" class="fnnum">128</a>
      they in vain sought an excuse for fighting. For when the natives were
      ordered to contribute money and arms, they brought a gratuitous present of
      provisions as well. Lugdunum did gladly what the Aedui had done from fear.
      But the town was deprived of the Italian legion and Taurus' <a
      name="1fnm129"></a>Horse.<a href="#1fn129" class="fnnum">129</a> Valens
      decided to leave the Eighteenth <a name="1fnm130"></a>cohort<a
      href="#1fn130" class="fnnum">130</a> there in its old winter quarters as a
      garrison. Manlius Valens, who was in command of the Italian legion, never
      received any distinction from Vitellius, although he deserved well of the
      party, the reason being that Fabius slandered him behind his back, while
      to avert his suspicions he praised him to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap65" id="Ichap65"></a><span class="chapnum">65</span>The
      recent <a name="1fnm131"></a>war<a href="#1fn131" class="fnnum">131</a>
      had served to inflame the long-standing quarrel between Lugdunum and <a
      name="1fnm132"></a>Vienne.<a href="#1fn132" class="fnnum">132</a> Much
      damage was done on both sides, and the frequency and animosity of their
      conflicts proved that they were not merely fighting for Nero and Galba.
      Galba had made his displeasure an excuse for confiscating to the Treasury
      the revenues of Lugdunum, while on Vienne he had conferred various
      distinctions. The result was a bitter rivalry between the towns, and the
      Rhone between them only formed a bond of <a name="1page81"></a><span
      class="pagenum">81</span>hatred. Consequently the inhabitants of Lugdunum
      began to work on the feelings of individual Roman soldiers, and to urge
      them to crush Vienne. They reminded them how the Viennese had laid siege
      to Lugdunum, a Roman colony, had assisted the efforts of , and had lately
      raised troops to defend Galba. Having supplied a pretext for bad feeling,
      they went on to point out the rich opportunity for plunder. Not content
      with private persuasion, they presented a formal petition that the army
      would march to avenge them, and destroy the head-quarters of the Gallic
      war. Vienne, they urged, was thoroughly un-Roman and hostile, while
      Lugdunum was a Roman <a name="1fnm133"></a>colony,<a href="#1fn133"
      class="fnnum">133</a> contributing men to the army and sharing in its
      victories and reverses. They besought them in the event of adverse fortune
      not to leave their city to the fury of its enemies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap66" id="Ichap66"></a><span class="chapnum">66</span>By these
      arguments and others of the same nature they brought matters to such a
      pass, that even the generals and party leaders despaired of cooling the
      army's indignation. However, the Viennese realized their danger. Arrayed
      in veils and <a name="1fnm134"></a>fillets,<a href="#1fn134" class="fnnum">134</a>
      they met the approaching column and, seizing their hands and knees and the
      soles of their feet in supplication, succeeded in appeasing the troops.
      Valens made each <a name="1page82"></a><span class="pagenum">82</span>of
      the soldiers a present of three hundred <a name="1fnm135"></a>sesterces.<a
      href="#1fn135" class="fnnum">135</a> They were thus persuaded to respect
      the antiquity and high standing of the colony, and to listen with patience
      to their general's speech, in which he commended to them the lives and
      property of the Viennese. However, the town was disarmed, and private
      individuals had to assist the army with various kinds of provisions. There
      was, however, a persistent rumour that Valens himself had been bought with
      a heavy bribe. He had long been in mean circumstances and ill concealed
      his sudden accession of wealth. Prolonged poverty had whetted his
      inordinate desires, and the needy youth grew into an extravagant old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He next led the army by slow stages through the country of the Allobroges
      and <a name="1fnm136"></a>Vocontii,<a href="#1fn136" class="fnnum">136</a>
      bribes to the general determining the length of each day's march and the
      choice of a camp. For Valens struck disgraceful bargains with the
      landowners and municipal authorities, often applying violent threats, as,
      for instance, at Lucus,<a name="1fnm137"></a><a href="#1fn137"
      class="fnnum">137</a> a township of the Vocontii, which he threatened to
      burn, until he was appeased with money. Where it was impossible to get
      money, he was mollified by appeals to his lust. And so it went on until
      the Alps were reached.

      <a name="The_March_of_Caecinas_Column" id="The_March_of_Caecinas_Column"></a>The
      March of Caecina's Column
    </h3>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap67" id="Ichap67"></a><span class="chapnum">67</span>There
      was even more looting and bloodshed on Caecina's march. The Helvetii, a
      Gallic <a name="1fnm138"></a>tribe<a href="#1fn138" class="fnnum">138</a>
      once famous as fighting men and still distinguished by the memory of their
      past, having heard nothing of Galba's murder, refused to acknowledge the
      authority of Vitellius. This exasperated Caecina's headstrong nature.
      Hostilities broke out owing to the greed and impatience of the
      Twenty-first legion, who had seized a sum of money which was being sent to
      pay the garrison of a fort in which the Helvetii used to keep native
      troops at their own <a name="1fnm139"></a>expense.<a href="#1fn139"
      class="fnnum">139</a> The Helvetii, highly indignant at this, intercepted
      a dispatch from the German army to the Pannonian legions, and kept a
      centurion and some men in custody. Greedy for battle, Caecina hastened to
      take immediate vengeance without giving them time for second thoughts.
      Promptly breaking up his camp, he proceeded to harry the country, and
      sacked a charming and much-frequented watering-place,<a name="1fnm140"></a><a
      href="#1fn140" class="fnnum">140</a> which had grown during the long peace
      into the size and importance of a town. Instructions were sent to the
      Raetian auxiliaries to attack the Helvetii in the rear, while their
      attention was occupied with the legion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1page84"></a><span class="pagenum">84</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap68" id="Ichap68"></a><span class="chapnum">68</span>Full of
      spirit beforehand, the Helvetii were terrified in the face of danger. At
      the first alarm they had chosen Claudius Severus general, but they knew
      nothing of fighting or discipline and were incapable of combined action.
      An engagement with the Roman veterans would be disastrous; and the walls,
      dilapidated by time, could not stand a siege. They found themselves
      between Caecina and his powerful army on the one side, and on the other
      the Raetian auxiliaries, both horse and foot, and the whole fighting force
      of Raetia as well, trained soldiers well used to <a name="1fnm141"></a>fighting.<a
      href="#1fn141" class="fnnum">141</a> Their country was given over to
      plunder and massacre. Flinging away their arms, they wandered miserably
      between two fires. Wounded and scattered, most of them took refuge on the
      B&ouml;tzberg.<a name="1fnm142"></a><a href="#1fn142" class="fnnum">142</a>
      But some Thracian auxiliaries were promptly sent to dislodge them. The
      German army, aided by the Raetians, pursued them through the woods, and
      cut them to pieces in their hiding-places. Many thousands were killed and
      many sold as slaves. Having completed the work of destruction, the army
      advanced in hostile array against <a name="1fnm143"></a>Aventicum,<a
      href="#1fn143" class="fnnum">143</a> their capital town, and were met by
      envoys offering surrender. The offer was accepted. Caecina executed Julius
      Alpinus, one of their chief men, as the prime instigator of the revolt.
      The rest he left to experience the clemency or cruelty of Vitellius.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap69" id="Ichap69"></a><span class="chapnum">69</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is hard to say whether these envoys found Vitellius or the army the
      more implacable. The soldiers <a name="1page85"></a><span class="pagenum">85</span>clamoured
      for the destruction of the <a name="1fnm144"></a>town,<a href="#1fn144"
      class="fnnum">144</a> and shook their fists and weapons in the envoys'
      faces: even Vitellius indulged in threatening language. Ultimately,
      however, Claudius Cossus, one of the envoys, a noted speaker who greatly
      enhanced the effect of his eloquence by concealing his skill under a
      well-timed affectation of nervousness, succeeded in softening the hearts
      of the soldiers. A mob is always liable to sudden changes of feeling, and
      the men were as sensible to pity as they had been extravagant in their
      brutality. Thus with streams of tears and importunate prayers for a better
      answer the envoys procured a free pardon for <a name="1fnm145"></a>Aventicum.<a

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap70" id="Ichap70"></a><span class="chapnum">70</span>Caecina
      halted for a few days in Helvetian territory until he could get news of
      Vitellius' decision. Meantime, while carrying on his preparations for
      crossing the Alps, he received from Italy the joyful news that 'Silius'
      Horse',<a name="1fnm146"></a><a href="#1fn146" class="fnnum">146</a>
      stationed at Padua, had come over to Vitellius. The members of this troop
      had served under Vitellius when pro-consul in Africa. They had
      subsequently been detached under orders from Nero to precede him to Egypt,
      and had then been recalled, owing to the outbreak of the war with . They
      were now in Italy. Their officers, who knew nothing <a name="1page86"></a><span
      class="pagenum">86</span>of Otho and were attached to Vitellius, extolled
      the strength of the approaching column and the fame of the German army. So
      the troop went over to Vitellius, bringing their new emperor a gift of the
      four strongest towns of the Transpadane district, Milan, Novara, Eporedia,<a
      name="1fnm147"></a><a href="#1fn147" class="fnnum">147</a> and Vercelli.
      Of this they informed Caecina themselves. But one troop of horse could not
      garrison the whole of the widest part of Italy. Caecina accordingly
      hurried forward the Gallic, Lusitanian, and British auxiliaries, and some
      German detachments, together with 'Petra's Horse',<a name="1fnm148"></a><a
      href="#1fn148" class="fnnum">148</a> while he himself hesitated whether he
      should not cross the Raetian <a name="1fnm149"></a>Alps<a href="#1fn149"
      class="fnnum">149</a> into Noricum and attack the governor, Petronius
      Urbicus, who, having raised a force of irregulars and broken down the
      bridges, was supposed to be a faithful adherent of Otho. However, he was
      afraid of losing the auxiliaries whom he had sent on ahead, and at the
      same time he considered that there was more glory in holding Italy, and
      that, wherever the theatre of the war might be, Noricum was sure to be
      among the spoils of victory. So he chose the Pennine <a name="1fnm150"></a>route<a
      href="#1fn150" class="fnnum">150</a> and led his legionaries and the heavy
      marching column across the Alps, although they were still deep in <a

      the Distribution of Forces
    </h3>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap71" id="Ichap71"></a><span class="chapnum">71</span>Meanwhile,
      contrary to all expectation, Otho was no prey to idle luxury. He postponed
      his pleasures and disguised his extravagance, suiting all his behaviour to
      the dignity of his position. But people knew they had not seen the last of
      his vices, and his virtuous hypocrisy only increased their alarm. He gave
      orders to summon Marius Celsus to the Capitol. This was the consul-elect
      whom he had rescued from the savage clutches of the soldiers by pretending
      to put him in <a name="1fnm152"></a>prison.<a href="#1fn152" class="fnnum">152</a>
      Otho now wanted to earn a name for clemency by pardoning a well-known man,
      who had fought against his party. Celsus was firm. Pleading guilty to the
      charge of fidelity to Galba, he went on to show that he had set an example
      which was all to Otho's advantage. Otho treated him as if there was
      nothing to pardon. Calling on heaven to witness their reconciliation, he
      then and there admitted him to the circle of his intimate friends, and
      subsequently gave him an appointment as one of his generals. Celsus
      remained faithful to Otho too, doomed apparently to the losing side. His
      acquittal, which delighted the upper classes and was popular with the mass
      of the people, even earned the approval of the soldiers, who now admired
      the qualities which had previously aroused their indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap72" id="Ichap72"></a><span class="chapnum">72</span>Equal
      rejoicing, though for different reasons, <a name="1page88"></a><span
      class="pagenum">88</span>followed the long-looked-for downfall of Ofonius
      Tigellinus. Born of obscure parentage, he had grown from an immoral youth
      into a vicious old man. He rose to the command first of the <a
      name="1fnm153"></a>Police,<a href="#1fn153" class="fnnum">153</a> and then
      of the Praetorian Guards, finding that vice was a short cut to such
      rewards of virtue. In these and other high offices he developed the vices
      of maturity, first cruelty, then greed. He corrupted Nero and introduced
      him to every kind of depravity; then ventured on some villainies behind
      his back, and finally deserted and betrayed him. Thus in his case, as in
      no other, those who hated Nero and those who wished him back agreed,
      though from different motives, in calling loudly for his execution. During
      Galba's reign he had been protected by the influence of Titus Vinius, on
      the plea that he had saved his daughter. Saved her he had, not from any
      feelings of pity (he had killed too many for that), but to secure a refuge
      for the future. For all such rascals, distrusting the present and fearing
      a change of fortune, always prepare for themselves a shelter against
      public indignation by obtaining the favour of private persons. So they
      rely to escape punishment not on their innocence but on a system of mutual
      insurance. People were all the more incensed against Tigellinus, since the
      recent feeling against Vinius was added to their old hatred for him. From
      all quarters of Rome they flocked to the palace and the squares; and above
      all, in the circus and the theatre, where the mob enjoys complete licence,
      they <a name="1page89"></a><span class="pagenum">89</span>assembled in
      crowds and broke out into riotous uproar. Eventually Tigellinus at
      Sinuessa <a name="1fnm154"></a>Spa<a href="#1fn154" class="fnnum">154</a>
      received the news that his last hour was inevitably come. There after a
      cowardly delay in the foul embraces of his prostitutes he cut his throat
      with a razor, and blackened the infamy of his life by a hesitating and
      shameful death.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap73" id="Ichap73"></a><span class="chapnum">73</span>About
      the same time there arose a demand for the punishment of Calvia
      Crispinilla. But she was saved by various prevarications, and Otho's
      connivence cost him some discredit. This woman had tutored Nero in vice,
      and afterwards crossed to Africa to incite Clodius <a name="1fnm155"></a>Macer<a
      href="#1fn155" class="fnnum">155</a> to civil war. While there she openly
      schemed to start a famine in Rome. However, she secured herself by
      marrying an ex-consul, and lived to enjoy a wide popularity in Rome. She
      escaped harm under Galba, Otho, and Vitellius, and eventually wielded a
      great influence due to her being both rich and childless, considerations
      of the first importance in any state of society.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap74" id="Ichap74"></a><span class="chapnum">74</span>During
      this time Otho wrote constantly to Vitellius, holding out various
      effeminate inducements, making him offers of money or an influential
      position, or any retreat he liked to select for a life of <a name="1fnm156"></a>luxury.<a
      href="#1fn156" class="fnnum">156</a> Vitellius made similar offers. At
      first both wrote in the mildest tone, though the affectation on either
      side was stupid <a name="1page90"></a><span class="pagenum">90</span>and
      inappropriate. But they soon struck a quarrelsome note, and reproached
      each other with immorality and crime, both with a good deal of truth. Otho
      recalled the commission which Galba had sent out to <a name="1fnm157"></a>Germany,<a
      href="#1fn157" class="fnnum">157</a> and, using the pretext of senatorial
      authority, sent fresh commissioners to both the armies in Germany, and
      also to the Italian legion, and the troops quartered at Lugdunum. However,
      the commissioners remained with Vitellius with a readiness which showed
      they were under no compulsion; and the guards who had been attached to
      them, ostensibly as a mark of honour, were sent back at once before they
      had time to mix with the legionary soldiers. Further than this, Fabius
      Valens sent letters in the name of the German army to the Guards and the
      City Garrison, extolling the strength of his own side and offering to join
      forces. He even went so far as to reproach them with having transferred to
      Otho the title which had long <a name="1fnm158"></a>before<a href="#1fn158"
      class="fnnum">158</a> been conferred on Vitellius. <a name="Ichap75"
      id="Ichap75"></a><span class="chapnum">75</span>Thus they were assailed
      with threats as well as promises, and told that they were not strong
      enough to fight, and had nothing to lose by making peace. But, in spite of
      all, the fidelity of the Guards remained unchanged. However, Otho
      dispatched assassins to Germany, Vitellius to Rome. Neither met with
      success. Vitellius' assassins were lost <a name="1page91"></a><span
      class="pagenum">91</span>in the crowds of Rome, where nobody knows
      anybody, and thus escaped detection: Otho's were betrayed by their strange
      faces, since the troops all knew each other by sight. Vitellius then
      composed a letter to Otho's brother <a name="1fnm159"></a>Titianus,<a
      href="#1fn159" class="fnnum">159</a> threatening that his life and his
      son's should answer for the safety of Vitellius' mother and children. As
      it happened neither household suffered. Fear was perhaps the reason in
      Otho's time, but Vitellius, after his victory, could certainly claim
      credit for clemency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first news which gave Otho any degree of confidence <a name="Ichap76"
      id="Ichap76"></a><span class="chapnum">76</span>was the announcement from
      Illyricum that the legions of Dalmatia and Pannonia and <a name="1fnm160"></a>Moesia<a
      href="#1fn160" class="fnnum">160</a> had sworn allegiance to him. Similar
      news arrived from Spain, and Cluvius <a name="1fnm161"></a>Rufus<a
      href="#1fn161" class="fnnum">161</a> was commended in a special decree,
      but it was found out immediately afterwards that Spain had gone over to
      Vitellius. Even Aquitania soon fell away, although Julius Cordus had sworn
      in the province for Otho. Loyalty and affection seemed dead: men changed
      from one side to the other under the stress of fear or compulsion. It was
      fear which gave Vitellius the Province of Narbonese <a name="1fnm162"></a>Gaul,<a
      href="#1fn162" class="fnnum">162</a> for it is easy to go over when the
      big battalions are so near. The distant provinces and the troops across
      the sea all remained at Otho's disposal, but not from any enthusiasm for
      <a name="1page92"></a><span class="pagenum">92</span>his cause; what
      weighed with them was the name of Rome and the title of the senate.
      Besides, Otho had got the first hearing. Vespasian swore in the Jewish
      <a name="1fnm163"></a>army<a href="#1fn163" class="fnnum">163</a> for
      Otho, and Mucianus the legions in Syria;<a name="1fnm164"></a><a
      href="#1fn164" class="fnnum">164</a> Egypt too and all the provinces
      towards the East were held for him. He also received the submission of
      Africa, where Carthage had taken the lead, without waiting for the
      sanction of the governor, Vipstanus Apronianus. Crescens, one of Nero's
      freedmen&mdash;in evil days these creatures play a part in <a
      name="1fnm165"></a>politics<a href="#1fn165" class="fnnum">165</a>&mdash;had
      given the common people of the town a gala dinner in honour of the new
      emperor, with the result that the inhabitants hurried into various
      excesses. The other African communities followed the example of Carthage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap77" id="Ichap77"></a><span class="chapnum">77</span>The
      provinces and their armies being thus divided, Vitellius could only win
      the throne by fighting. Otho meanwhile was carrying on the government as
      if the time were one of profound peace. Sometimes he consulted the
      country's dignity, though more often the exigencies of the moment forced
      him into unseemly haste. He held the consulship himself with his brother
      Titianus as colleague until the first of March. For the next two months he
      appointed Verginius, as a sort of sop to the army in <a name="1fnm166"></a>Germany.<a
      href="#1fn166" class="fnnum">166</a> As colleague he gave <a name="1page93"></a><span
      class="pagenum">93</span>him Pompeius Vopiscus, ostensibly because he was
      an old friend of his own, but it was generally understood as a compliment
      to <a name="1fnm167"></a>Vienne.<a href="#1fn167" class="fnnum">167</a>
      For the rest of the year the appointments which Nero or Galba had made
      were allowed to stand. The brothers Caelius and Flavius <a name="1fnm168"></a>Sabinus<a
      href="#1fn168" class="fnnum">168</a> were consuls for June and July,
      Arrius <a name="1fnm169"></a>Antoninus<a href="#1fn169" class="fnnum">169</a>
      and Marius Celsus for August and September; even Vitellius after his
      victory did not cancel their appointment. To the pontifical and augural
      colleges Otho either nominated old ex-magistrates, as the final crown of
      their career, or else, when young aristocrats returned from exile, he
      instated them by way of recompense in the pontifical posts which their
      fathers or grandfathers had held. He restored Cadius Rufus, Pedius
      Blaesus, and <i>Saevinus Proculus</i><a name="1fnm170"></a><a
      href="#1fn170" class="fnnum">170</a> to their seats in the senate. They
      had been convicted during Claudius' and Nero's reigns of extortion in the
      provinces. In pardoning them the name of their offence was changed, and
      their greed appeared as 'treason'. For so unpopular was the law of treason
      that it sapped the force of better <a name="1fnm171"></a>statutes.<a
      href="#1fn171" class="fnnum">171</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap78" id="Ichap78"></a><span class="chapnum">78</span>Otho
      next tried to win over the municipalities and provincial towns by similar
      bribes. At the colonies <a name="1page94"></a><span class="pagenum">94</span>of
      Hispalis and <a name="1fnm172"></a>Emerita<a href="#1fn172" class="fnnum">172</a>
      he enrolled new families of settlers, granted the franchise to the whole
      community of the <a name="1fnm173"></a>Lingones,<a href="#1fn173"
      class="fnnum">173</a> and made over certain Moorish towns as a gift to the
      province of Baetica. Cappadocia and Africa were also granted new
      privileges, as showy as they were short-lived. All these grants are
      excused by the exigences of the moment and the impending crisis, but he
      even found time to remember his old amours and passed a measure through
      the senate restoring Poppaea's <a name="1fnm174"></a>statues.<a
      href="#1fn174" class="fnnum">174</a> He is believed also to have thought
      of celebrating Nero's memory as a means of attracting public sympathy.
      Some persons actually erected statues of Nero, and there were times when
      the populace and the soldiers, by way of enhancing his fame and dignity,
      saluted him as Nero Otho. However, he refused to commit himself. He was
      ashamed to accept the title, yet afraid to forbid its use.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap79" id="Ichap79"></a><span class="chapnum">79</span>While
      the whole of Rome was intent upon the civil war, foreign affairs were
      neglected. Consequently a Sarmatian tribe called the <a name="1fnm175"></a>Rhoxolani,<a
      href="#1fn175" class="fnnum">175</a> who had cut up two cohorts of
      auxiliaries in the previous winter, <a name="1page95"></a><span
      class="pagenum">95</span>now formed the still more daring scheme of
      invading Moesia. Inspirited by success, they assembled nearly 9,000
      mounted men, all more intent on plunder than on fighting. While they were
      riding about aimlessly without any suspicion of danger, they were suddenly
      attacked by the Third <a name="1fnm176"></a>legion<a href="#1fn176"
      class="fnnum">176</a> and its native auxiliaries. On the Roman side
      everything was ready for a battle: the Sarmatians were scattered over the
      country; some in their greed for plunder were heavily laden, and their
      horses could scarcely move on the slippery roads. They were caught in a
      trap and cut to pieces. It is quite extraordinary how all a Sarmatian's
      courage is, so to speak, outside himself. Fighting on foot, no one is more
      cowardly; but their cavalry charge would break almost any troops. On this
      occasion it was raining and the ground was greasy with thaw; their pikes
      and their long swords, needing both hands to wield, were useless; their
      horses slipped and they were encumbered by the heavy coat of mail which
      all their chiefs and nobles wear. Being made of iron plates and a very
      hard kind of leather, it is impenetrable to blows, but most inconvenient
      for any one who is knocked down by a charge of the enemy and tries to get
      up. Besides, they sank into the deep, soft snow. The Roman soldiers in
      their neat leather jerkins, armed with javelin and lance, and using, if
      need be, their light swords, sprang on the unarmed Sarmatians (they never
      carry shields) and stabbed them at close quarters. A few, surviving the
      battle, hid <a name="1page96"></a><span class="pagenum">96</span>themselves
      in the marshes, and there perished miserably from the severity of the
      winter and their wounds. When the news of this reached Rome, Marcus
      Aponius, the governor of Moesia, was granted a triumphal <a name="1fnm177"></a>statue,<a
      href="#1fn177" class="fnnum">177</a> while the commanding officers of the
      legions, Fulvius Aurelius, Tettius Julianus, and Numisius Lupus, received
      the insignia of consular rank. Otho was delighted and took all the credit
      to himself, as if he had been the successful general, and had himself
      employed his officers and armies to enlarge the empire.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap80" id="Ichap80"></a><span class="chapnum">80</span>In the
      meantime a riot broke out in an unexpected quarter, and, though trivial at
      first, nearly ended in the destruction of Rome. Otho had given orders that
      the Seventeenth <a name="1fnm178"></a>cohort<a href="#1fn178" class="fnnum">178</a>
      should be summoned from the colony of Ostia to the city, and Varius
      Crispinus, a tribune of the guards, was instructed to provide them with
      arms. Anxious to carry out his instructions undisturbed while the camp was
      quiet, he arranged that the arsenal was to be opened and the cohort's
      wagons loaded after nightfall. The hour aroused suspicion; the motive was
      questioned; his choice of a quiet moment resulted in an uproar. The mere
      sight of swords made the drunken soldiers long to use them. They began to
      murmur and accuse their officers of treachery, suggesting that the
      senators' slaves were going to be armed against Otho. Some of <a
      name="1page97"></a><span class="pagenum">97</span>them were too fuddled to
      know what they were saying: the rascals saw a chance of plunder: the mass
      of them, as usual, were simply eager for a change: and such as were loyal
      could not carry out their orders in the darkness. When Crispinus tried to
      check them, the mutineers killed him together with the most determined of
      the centurions, seized their armour, bared their swords, and mounting the
      horses, made off at full speed for Rome and the palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap81" id="Ichap81"></a><span class="chapnum">81</span>It so
      happened that a large party of Roman senators and their wives was dining
      with Otho. In their alarm they wondered whether the soldiers' outbreak was
      unpremeditated or a ruse of the emperor's: would it be safer to fly in all
      directions or to stay and be arrested? At one moment they would make a
      show of firmness, at the next their terror betrayed them. All the time
      they were watching Otho's face, and, as happens when people suspect each
      other, he was just as afraid himself as they were of him. But feeling no
      less alarm for the senators than for himself, he promptly dispatched the
      prefects of the Guards to appease the anger of the troops, and told all
      his guests to leave immediately. Then on all sides Roman officials could
      be seen to throw away their insignia, avoid their suite, and slink off
      unattended. Old gentlemen and their wives roamed the dark streets in all
      directions. Few went home, most of them fled to friends, or sought an
      obscure refuge with the humblest of their clients.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap82" id="Ichap82"></a><span class="chapnum">82</span>The
      soldiers' onrush could not be stopped at the gates of the palace. They
      demanded to see Otho and <a name="1page98"></a><span class="pagenum">98</span>invaded
      the banquet-hall. Julius Martialis, a tribune of the Guards, and Vitellius
      Saturninus, the camp-prefect<a name="1fnm179"></a><a href="#1fn179"
      class="fnnum">179</a> of the legion, were wounded while endeavouring to
      bar their progress. On every side they brandished swords and hurled
      threats, now against their officers, now against the whole senate; and
      since they could not select any one victim for their wrath, in a blind
      frenzy of panic they clamoured for a free hand against all the senators.
      At last Otho, sacrificing his dignity, stood up on a couch and with great
      difficulty restrained them by means of prayers and tears. They returned to
      their camp unwillingly, and with a guilty conscience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Rome was like a captured city. The houses were all shut, the
      streets almost deserted, and everybody looked depressed. The soldiers,
      too, hung their heads, though they were more sulky than sorry for what
      they had done. Their prefects, Licinius Proculus and Plotius Firmus,
      harangued them by companies, the one mildly, the other harshly, for they
      were men of different natures. They concluded by announcing that the men
      were to receive five thousand <a name="1page99"></a><span class="pagenum">99</span>sesterces<a
      name="1fnm180"></a><a href="#1fn180" class="fnnum">180</a> apiece. After
      that Otho ventured to enter the camp. The tribunes and centurions each
      flinging away the insignia of his rank,<a name="1fnm181"></a><a
      href="#1fn181" class="fnnum">181</a> crowded round him begging for a safe
      discharge. Stung by the disgrace of this, the troops soon quieted down,
      and even went the length of demanding that the ringleaders should be
      punished. <a name="Ichap83" id="Ichap83"></a><span class="chapnum">83</span>In
      the general disturbance Otho's position was difficult. The soldiers were
      by no means unanimous. The better sort wanted him to put a stop to the
      prevalent insubordination, but the great bulk of them liked
      faction-fighting and emperors who had to court their favour, and with the
      prospect of rioting and plunder were ready enough for civil war. He
      realized, also, that one who wins a throne by violence cannot keep it by
      suddenly trying to enforce the rigid discipline of earlier days. However,
      the danger of the crisis both for the city and the senate seriously
      alarmed him, so he finally delivered himself as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      'Fellow soldiers, I have not come to fan the fire of your affection for
      me, or to instil courage into your hearts: in both those qualities you are
      more than rich. No, I have come to ask you to moderate your courage and to
      set some bounds to your affection. These recent disturbances did not
      originate in those passions of greed or violence, which so often cause
      <a name="1page100"></a><span class="pagenum">100</span>dissension in an
      army; nor was it that you feared some danger and tried to shirk it. The
      sole cause was your excessive loyalty, which you displayed with more
      ardour than judgement. For with the best of motives, indiscretion often
      lands men in disaster. We are preparing for war. Do you imagine that we
      could publish all our dispatches, and discuss our plans in the presence of
      the whole army, when we have to devise a systematic campaign and keep up
      with the rapid changes of the situation? There are things a soldier ought
      to know, but there is much of which he must be ignorant. It is necessary
      for the maintenance of strict discipline and of the general's authority
      that even his tribunes and centurions should often obey blindly. If every
      one is going to inquire into his motives, discipline is done for, and his
      authority falls to the ground. Suppose in actual warfare you are called to
      arms at dead of night: shall a few drunken blackguards&mdash;for I cannot
      believe that many lost their heads in the recent panic&mdash;go and stain
      their hands with their officers' blood, and then break into the general's
      tent?
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap84" id="Ichap84"></a><span class="chapnum">84</span>'Now I
      know you did it to protect me, but the riot and the darkness and the
      general confusion might easily have provided an opportunity to kill me.
      Suppose Vitellius and his satellites had their choice of the state of mind
      they would pray to find us in; what more could they desire than mutiny and
      dissension, the men insubordinate to the centurions, and the centurions to
      their superior officers, and the whole force, horse and foot alike,
      rushing in headlong confusion to <a name="1page101"></a><span
      class="pagenum">101</span>their ruin? Good soldiering, my comrades,
      consists in obedience, not in scrutinizing the general's orders; and the
      army which is most orderly in peace is most courageous on the field of
      battle. Yours are the swords and the courage; you must leave it to me to
      plan the campaign, and to direct your valour. The culprits were but few,
      and only two are to be punished; the rest of you must blot out all memory
      of that discreditable night. No army must ever hear again such words
      spoken against the senate. It is the brain of the empire and the glory of
      all the provinces. Why, in Heaven's name, the very Germans themselves,
      whom Vitellius is stirring up with all his might against us, would not
      dare to call its members into question! Shall it be said that Italy's own
      sons, the real soldiery of Rome, are clamouring to murder and massacre the
      very senators whose lustre it is that throws into the shade the obscure
      and vulgar adherents of Vitellius? Vitellius has seized a few provinces
      and raised a sort of shadow of an army; but the senate is on our side.
      Therefore, Rome is for us; they are against her. Do you imagine that the
      stability of this beautiful city consists in houses and edifices built of
      stone upon stone? Nay, they are dumb inanimate things that may fall to
      pieces and be rebuilt at pleasure. The eternity of our empire, the peace
      of the world, your welfare and mine, all depend upon the safety of the
      senate. Instituted with solemn ceremony by the father and founder of Rome,
      the senate has come down in undying continuity from the kings to the
      emperors; and as we have received <a name="1page102"></a><span
      class="pagenum">102</span>it from our ancestors, so let us hand it on to
      our posterity. From your ranks come the senators, and from the senate come
      the emperors of Rome.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap85" id="Ichap85"></a><span class="chapnum">85</span>This
      speech, as being well calculated to provide a reprimand and a sedative for
      the soldiers, and Otho's moderation&mdash;for he only ordered the
      punishment of two men&mdash;were well received. He had calmed for a moment
      the troops he could not control. Yet peace and quiet were not restored in
      Rome. One could still detect the clash of arms and the lurid face of war.
      Refraining from organized riot, the soldiers now dispersed to private
      houses and lived in disguise, giving vent to their bad feeling by
      maligning all whom nobility of birth or wealth or any other distinction
      made a mark for scandal. Many, besides, believed that some of Vitellius'
      soldiers had come to Rome to study the state of party feeling. Everywhere
      suspicion was rife, and terror invaded even the privacy of the home. But
      far greater was the alarm displayed in public places. With every fresh
      piece of news that rumour brought, men's feelings and the expression on
      their faces changed. They were afraid to be found lacking in confidence
      when things looked doubtful, or in joy when they went well for Otho. Above
      all, when the senate was summoned to the House, they found it
      extraordinarily hard always to strike the right note. Silence would argue
      arrogance; plain speaking would arouse suspicion; yet flattery would be
      detected by Otho, who had so lately been a private citizen, practising the
      art himself. So they had to <a name="1page103"></a><span class="pagenum">103</span>turn
      and twist their sentences. Vitellius they called enemy and traitor, the
      more prudent confining themselves to such vague generalities. A few
      ventured to fling the truth at him, but they always chose a moment of
      uproar when a great many people were all shouting at once, or else they
      talked so loud and fast as to drown their own words.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap86" id="Ichap86"></a><span class="chapnum">86</span>Another
      cause of alarm was the various portents vouched for by many witnesses. In
      the Capitoline Square, it was said, the figure of Victory had let the
      reins of her chariot slip from her hands: a ghost of superhuman size had
      suddenly burst out of the chapel of Juno:<a name="1fnm182"></a><a
      href="#1fn182" class="fnnum">182</a> a statue of the sainted Julius on the
      island in the Tiber had, on a fine, still day, turned round from the west
      and faced the east: an ox had spoken in Etruria: animals had given birth
      to strange monsters. Many were the stories of these occurrences, which in
      primitive ages are observed even in time of peace, though now we only hear
      of them in time of panic. But the greatest damage at the moment, and the
      greatest alarm for the future, was caused by a sudden rising of the Tiber.
      Immensely swollen, it carried away the bridge on <a name="1fnm183"></a>piles,<a
      href="#1fn183" class="fnnum">183</a> and, its current being stemmed by the
      heavy ruins, it flooded not only the flat, low-lying portions of the city,
      but also districts <a name="1page104"></a><span class="pagenum">104</span>that
      seemed safe from inundation. Many people were swept away in the streets,
      still more were overtaken by the flood in shops or in their beds at home.
      The result was a famine, since food was <a name="1fnm184"></a>scarce,<a
      href="#1fn184" class="fnnum">184</a> and the poor were deprived of their
      means of livelihood. Blocks of flats, the foundations of which had rotted
      in the standing water, collapsed when the river sank. No sooner had the
      panic caused by the flood subsided than it was found that, whereas Otho
      was preparing an expedition, its route over the Martian Plain and up the
      Flaminian Road was blocked. Though probably caused by chance, or the
      course of Nature, this mishap was turned into a miraculous omen of
      impending disaster.

      class="fnnum">185</a> and meditated his plans for the war. Recognizing
      that the Pennine and Cottian Alps and all the other passes into Gaul were
      held by Vitellius, he decided to invade Narbonese Gaul by sea. His fleet
      was now a strong and reliable arm, devoted to his cause. For he had formed
      the full strength of a legion out of the survivors of the Mulvian Bridge
      massacre,<a name="1fnm186"></a><a href="#1fn186" class="fnnum">186</a>
      whom Galba's cruelty had <a name="1page105"></a><span class="pagenum">105</span>kept
      in prison, and to all the marines he had held out hopes of honourable <a
      name="1fnm187"></a>service.<a href="#1fn187" class="fnnum">187</a> To the
      fleet he attached the cohorts of the City Garrison and a large force of
      Guards. These were the flower of the army and its chief strength, well
      able to advise their own generals and to take good care of them. The
      command of the expedition was entrusted to Antonius Novellus and Suedius
      Clemens, both senior <a name="1fnm188"></a>centurions,<a href="#1fn188"
      class="fnnum">188</a> and to Aemilius Pacensis, to whom Otho had restored
      his <a name="1fnm189"></a>commission,<a href="#1fn189" class="fnnum">189</a>
      of which Galba had deprived him. In charge of the fleet he still retained
      the freedman <a name="1fnm190"></a>Moschus<a href="#1fn190" class="fnnum">190</a>
      to keep an eye on his betters. In command of the cavalry and infantry he
      placed Suetonius Paulinus, Marius Celsus, and Annius Gallus, but the man
      in whom he put most faith was the Prefect of the Guards, Licinius
      Proculus. This officer had shown himself efficient in garrison service,
      but was without any experience of warfare. He maligned the characteristic
      virtues of his colleagues, Paulinus' power of influence, Celsus' energy,
      Gallus' ripe judgement, and being a knave and no fool, he easily got the
      better of men who were both honest and loyal.

    <p>
      <a name="Ichap88" id="Ichap88"></a><span class="chapnum">88</span>It was
      about this time that Cornelius <a name="1fnm191"></a>Dolabella<a
      href="#1fn191" class="fnnum">191</a> was banished to the colony of <a
      name="1fnm192"></a>Aquinum,<a href="#1fn192" class="fnnum">192</a> though
      not <a name="1page106"></a><span class="pagenum">106</span>kept in close
      or dishonourable confinement. There was no charge against him: the stigma
      upon him was his ancient name and <a name="1fnm193"></a>kinship<a
      href="#1fn193" class="fnnum">193</a> to Galba. Otho issued orders that
      several of the magistrates and a large number of ex-consuls were to join
      the expedition, not to take part in the campaign or to assist in any way,
      but simply as a friendly escort. Among these was Lucius Vitellius, whom he
      treated neither as an emperor's brother nor as the brother of an enemy,
      but just like anybody else. Much anxiety was aroused for the safety of the
      city, where all classes feared danger. The leading members of the senate
      were old and infirm, and enervated by a long period of peace: the
      aristocracy were inefficient and had forgotten how to fight: the knights
      knew nothing of military service. The more they all tried to conceal their
      alarm, the more obvious it became. Some of them, on the other hand, went
      in for senseless display, and purchased beautiful armour and fine horses:
      others procured as provisions of war elaborate dinner-services or some
      other contrivance to stimulate a jaded taste. Prudent men were concerned
      for the country's peace: the frivolous, without a thought for the future,
      were inflated by empty hopes: a good many, whose loss of credit made peace
      unwelcome, were delighted at the general unrest, feeling safer among
      uncertainties. <a name="Ichap89" id="Ichap89"></a><span class="chapnum">89</span>Though
      the cares of state were too vast to arouse any interest in the masses, yet
      as the price of food rose, and the whole revenue was devoted to military
      purposes, the common <a name="1page107"></a><span class="pagenum">107</span>people
      gradually began to realize the evils of war. During the revolt of they had
      not suffered so much. Being carried on in the provinces between the
      legionaries and the natives of Gaul it was to all intents a foreign war,
      and the city had not been affected. For from the time when the sainted
      Augustus organized the rule of the Caesars the wars of the Roman people
      had been fought in distant countries: all the anxiety and all the glory
      fell to the emperor alone. Under Tiberius and Caligula the country only
      suffered from the evils of <a name="1fnm194"></a>peace.<a href="#1fn194"
      class="fnnum">194</a> Scribonianus' rising against Claudius was no sooner
      heard of than <a name="1fnm195"></a>crushed.<a href="#1fn195" class="fnnum">195</a>
      Nero had been dethroned more by rumours and dispatches than by force of
      arms. But now not only the legions and the fleet, but, as had seldom
      happened before, the Guards and the City Garrison were called out for the
      campaign. Behind them were the East and the West and all the forces of the
      empire, material for a long war under any other generals. An attempt was
      made to delay Otho's departure by pointing out the impiety of his not
      having replaced the sacred shields in the temple of Mars.<a name="1fnm196"></a><a
      href="#1fn196" class="fnnum">196</a> But delay had ruined Nero: Otho would
      have none of it. And the knowledge that Caecina <a name="1page108"></a><span
      class="pagenum">108</span>had already crossed the <a name="1fnm197"></a>Alps<a
      href="#1fn197" class="fnnum">197</a> acted as a further stimulus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Ichap90" id="Ichap90"></a><span class="chapnum">90</span>Accordingly,
      on the fourteenth of March he commended the government of the country to
      the senate, and granted to the restored exiles all the rest of the
      property confiscated by Nero which had not yet been sold for the imperial
      <a name="1fnm198"></a>treasury.<a href="#1fn198" class="fnnum">198</a> The
      gift was a just one, and made a very good impression, but as a matter of
      fact it was nullified by the haste with which the work of collecting the
      money had been <a name="1fnm199"></a>conducted.<a href="#1fn199"
      class="fnnum">199</a> He then summoned a public meeting, and, after
      extolling the majesty of Rome and praising the wholehearted adherence of
      the senate and people to his cause, he used very moderate language against
      the Vitellian party, criticizing the legions more for folly than treason,
      and making no mention of Vitellius himself. This may have been due to his
      own moderation, or it may be that the writer of the speech felt some
      qualms for his own safety, and therefore refrained from insulting
      Vitellius. For it was generally believed that as in strategy he took the
      advice of Suetonius Paulinus and Marius Celsus, so too in political
      matters he employed the talents of Galerius <a name="1fnm200"></a>Trachalus.<a
      href="#1fn200" class="fnnum">200</a> Some <a name="1page109"></a><span
      class="pagenum">109</span>people even thought they could recognize
      Trachalus' style of oratory, fluent and sonorous, well adapted to tickle
      the ears of the crowd: and as he was a popular pleader his style was well
      known. The crowd's loud shouts of applause were in the best style of
      flattery, excessive and insincere. Men vied with each other in their
      enthusiasm and prayers for his success, much as though they were sending
      off the dictator Caesar or the emperor Augustus. Their motive was neither
      fear nor affection, but a sheer passion for servility. One can see the
      same in households of slaves, where each obeys his own interest and the
      common welfare counts for nothing. On his departure Otho entrusted the
      peace of the city and the interests of the empire to his brother Salvius
      Titianus.

      <a name="IIchap1" id="IIchap1"></a><span class="chapnum">1</span>Meanwhile,
      on the other side of Europe, Fortune was already sowing the seeds of a
      dynasty, the varying fortunes of which were destined to bring at one time
      happiness to the country and success to its rulers, at another misery to
      the country and to the rulers destruction.<a name="1fnm201"></a><a
      href="#1fn201" class="fnnum">201</a> Before Galba's fall Titus Vespasianus
      had been dispatched by his father from Judaea to <a name="1fnm202"></a>Rome.<a
      href="#1fn202" class="fnnum">202</a> The ostensible reason of his journey
      was to show respect to the new emperor, and to solicit some post for which
      his years now fitted <a name="1fnm203"></a>him.<a href="#1fn203"
      class="fnnum">203</a> However, the popular passion for invention suggested
      that he had been summoned to be adopted. This rumour was based on the fact
      that Galba was old and childless: the public never wearies of appointing
      successors until the choice is made. The character of Titus gave still
      more colour to it. He seemed capable of filling any position. His
      appearance lacked neither charm nor dignity. Vespasian's successes also
      and the utterances of certain oracles further endorsed the rumour, to say
      nothing of the chance occurrences which pass for omens where the wish is
      father to the thought. It <a name="1page111"></a><span class="pagenum">111</span>was
      at Corinth in Achaia that Titus received the news of Galba's murder, and
      was assured by people in the town that Vitellius had declared war. In
      great perplexity he summoned a few of his friends and discussed all the
      possibilities of the situation. If he continued his journey to Rome he
      would earn no gratitude for compliments addressed to another <a
      name="1fnm204"></a>sovereign,<a href="#1fn204" class="fnnum">204</a> and
      would be held as a hostage either for Vitellius or for Otho: on the other
      hand, if he returned to Judaea he would inevitably offend the victor.
      However, the struggle was still undecided, and the father's adherence to
      the successful party would excuse the conduct of the son. Or if Vespasian
      himself assumed sovereignty, they would have to plan war and forget all
      about giving offence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap2" id="IIchap2"></a><span class="chapnum">2</span>Such
      considerations held him balanced between hope and fear; but ultimately
      hope prevailed. Some people believed that his longing to get back to Queen
      <a name="1fnm205"></a>Berenice<a href="#1fn205" class="fnnum">205</a>
      fired him to return. True, the young man's fancy was attracted by
      Berenice, but he did not allow this to interfere with business. Still his
      youth was a time of gay self-indulgence, and he showed more restraint in
      his own reign than in his father's. Accordingly he sailed along the coasts
      of Greece and Asia Minor, <a name="1page112"></a><span class="pagenum">112</span>and,
      skirting the seas which lay upon his left, reached the islands of Rhodes
      and Cyprus, whence he made a bolder crossing to <a name="1fnm206"></a>Syria.<a
      href="#1fn206" class="fnnum">206</a> On his way he conceived a desire to
      visit the temple of Venus at <a name="1fnm207"></a>Paphos,<a href="#1fn207"
      class="fnnum">207</a> which is famous among all the inhabitants and
      visitors. It may not be tedious to give here a short account of the origin
      of this worship, the ritual of the cult, and the shape&mdash;unparalleled
      elsewhere&mdash;in which the goddess is depicted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap3" id="IIchap3"></a><span class="chapnum">3</span>According
      to an old tradition the temple was founded by King Aerias, and some people
      maintain that the goddess bears the same name. A more modern version
      states that the temple was consecrated by <a name="1fnm208"></a>Cinyras,<a
      href="#1fn208" class="fnnum">208</a> on the spot where the goddess landed
      when the sea gave her birth. The method of <a name="1fnm209"></a>divination,<a
      href="#1fn209" class="fnnum">209</a> however, according to this account,
      was imported from elsewhere by the Cilician Tamiras, and an arrangement
      was made that the descendants of both families should preside over the
      rites. Later, however, it seemed wrong that the royal line should have no
      prerogative, so the descendants of the <a name="1fnm210"></a>foreigner<a
      href="#1fn210" class="fnnum">210</a> resigned the practice of the art
      which they had themselves introduced, and now the priest whom you consult
      is always of the line of Cinyras. They accept any victim that is offered,
      but males are preferred. They put most faith <a name="1page113"></a><span
      class="pagenum">113</span>in kids' entrails. Blood must not be poured on
      the altar, at which they offer only prayers and fire untainted by smoke.
      Although the altars stand in the open air they are never wetted by rain.
      The goddess is not represented in human form; the idol is a sort of
      circular <a name="1fnm211"></a>pyramid,<a href="#1fn211" class="fnnum">211</a>
      rising from a broad base to a small round top, like a turning-post. The
      reason of this is unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap4" id="IIchap4"></a><span class="chapnum">4</span>Titus
      inspected the temple treasures and the offerings made by various kings,
      and other curiosities which the Greek passion for archaeology attributes
      to a dim antiquity. He then consulted the oracle first about his voyage.
      Learning that the sea was calm, and that no obstacles stood in his way, he
      sacrificed a large number of victims, and put covert questions about his
      own fortunes. The priest, whose name was Sostratus, seeing that the
      entrails were uniformly favourable, and that the goddess assented to
      Titus' ambitious schemes, returned at the moment a brief and ordinary
      reply, but afterwards sought a private interview and revealed the future
      to him. So Titus returned to his father with heightened hopes, and amid
      the general anxiety of the provinces and their armies his arrival spread
      boundless confidence of success.

      Vespasian had already broken the back of the Jewish <a name="1fnm212"></a>war.<a
      href="#1fn212" class="fnnum">212</a> Only the siege of Jerusalem remained.
      That this proved a difficult and laborious task was due rather to the high
      situation of the town and the <a name="1page114"></a><span class="pagenum">114</span>stubborn
      superstition of its inhabitants than to any adequate provision enabling
      them to endure the hardships of the siege. Vespasian had, as we have
      already <a name="1fnm213"></a>stated,<a href="#1fn213" class="fnnum">213</a>
      three legions well tried in war. Four others were under Mucianus' command.<a
      href="#1fn213" class="fnnum">213</a> Although these had never seen war,
      yet their envy of the neighbouring army's fame had banished sloth. Indeed,
      as the former were hardened by work and danger, so the latter owed their
      ardour to their unbroken inaction, and their shame at having no share in
      the war.<a name="1fnm214"></a><a href="#1fn214" class="fnnum">214</a> Both
      generals had, besides auxiliary infantry and cavalry, foreign <a

      allied <a name="1fnm216"></a>princes,<a href="#1fn216" class="fnnum">216</a>
      and a fame that rested on widely differing claims. <a name="IIchap5"
      id="IIchap5"></a><span class="chapnum">5</span>Vespasian was an
      indefatigable campaigner. He headed the column, chose the camping-ground,
      never ceasing by night or day to use strategy, and, if need be, the sword
      to thwart the enemy. He eat what he could get, and dressed almost like a
      common soldier. Indeed, save for his avarice, he matched the generals of
      old days. Mucianus, on the other hand, was distinguished by his wealth and
      luxury, and his general superiority to the standards of a private person.
      He was the better speaker, and a skilful administrator and statesman.
      Their combined qualities would have made a fine <a name="1page115"></a><span
      class="pagenum">115</span>emperor, if one could have blended their virtues
      and omitted their vices. Governing as they did the neighbouring provinces
      of Judaea and Syria, jealousy at first led to quarrels. However, on the
      death of Nero, they forgot their dislike and joined hands. It was their
      friends who first brought them together, and subsequently Titus became the
      chief bond of union and for the common good suppressed their ignoble
      jealousy. Both by nature and training he had charm to fascinate even such
      a man as Mucianus. The tribunes and centurions and the common soldiers
      were attracted, each according to his character, either by Titus'
      meritorious industry or by his gay indulgence in pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap6" id="IIchap6"></a><span class="chapnum">6</span>Before
      the arrival of Titus both armies had sworn allegiance to Otho. News
      travels fast in such cases, but civil war is a slow and serious
      undertaking, and the East, after its long repose, was now for the first
      time beginning to arm for it. In earlier times all the fiercest civil wars
      broke out in Italy or Cisalpine Gaul among the forces of the West. Pompey,
      Cassius, Brutus, and Antony all courted disaster by carrying the war
      oversea. Syria and Judaea often heard of Caesars, but seldom saw one.
      There were no mutinies among the soldiers. They merely made demonstrations
      against Parthia with varying success. Even in the last civil <a
      name="1fnm217"></a>war<a href="#1fn217" class="fnnum">217</a> the peace of
      these provinces had been untroubled by the general confusion. Later they
      were loyal to Galba. But when they heard that Otho and Vitellius were
      engaged in a wicked contest for the possession <a name="1page116"></a><span
      class="pagenum">116</span>of the Roman world, the troops began to chafe at
      the thought that the prizes of empire should fall to others, while their
      own lot was mere compulsory submission. They began to take stock of their
      strength. Syria and Judaea had seven legions on the spot with a vast force
      of auxiliaries. Next came Egypt with two legions:<a name="1fnm218"></a><a
      href="#1fn218" class="fnnum">218</a> beyond lay Cappadocia and Pontus, and
      all the forts along the Armenian frontier. Asia and the remaining
      provinces were rich and thickly populated. As for the islands, their
      girdle of sea was safe from the enemy and aided the prosecution of the
      war.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap7" id="IIchap7"></a><span class="chapnum">7</span>The
      generals were well aware of the soldiers' feelings, but decided to await
      the issue between Vitellius and Otho. 'In civil war,' they reckoned,
      'there are no sure ties to unite victor and vanquished. It matters little
      which survives: even good generals are corrupted by success: as for Otho
      and Vitellius, their troops are quarrelsome, lazy, and luxurious, and they
      are both the victims of their own vices. One will fall on the field and
      the other succumb to his success.' So Vespasian and Mucianus postponed
      their attack for the present. They were themselves recent converts to the
      project of war, which the <a name="1fnm219"></a>others<a href="#1fn219"
      class="fnnum">219</a> had long fostered from various motives. The better
      sort were animated by patriotism, many by mere love of plunder, some by
      the uncertainty of their own fortunes. Thus, though their motives
      differed, all, good and bad alike, agreed in their eager desire for war.

      About this time Achaia and Asia were thrown into 8 a groundless panic by a
      rumour that 'Nero was at hand'. The accounts of his death being many and
      various, people were all the more inclined to allege and to believe that
      he was still alive. We shall mention in the course of this work the
      attempts and the fate of the other pretenders.<a name="1fnm220"></a><a
      href="#1fn220" class="fnnum">220</a> This time it was a slave from Pontus,
      or, according to other traditions, a freedman from Italy. His skill as a
      singer and harpist, combined with his facial resemblance to Nero, gave him
      some credentials for imposture. He bribed some penniless and vagabond
      deserters by dazzling promises to join him, and they all set out to sea. A
      storm drove them on to the island of <a name="1fnm221"></a>Cythnus,<a
      href="#1fn221" class="fnnum">221</a> where he found some troops homeward
      bound on leave from the East. Some of these he enrolled, killing all who
      resisted, and then proceeded to plunder the local merchants and arm all
      the sturdiest of the slaves. Finding a centurion named Sisenna carrying
      home a pair of silver <a name="1fnm222"></a>hands<a href="#1fn222"
      class="fnnum">222</a> as a token of alliance from the army in Syria to the
      Household Guards, he tried by various devices to seduce him, until Sisenna
      took fright and escaped secretly from the island in fear of violence. Thus
      the panic spread. The great name of Nero attracted many who pined for
      revolution and hated the existing state of things. The rumours <a
      name="1page118"></a><span class="pagenum">118</span>waxed daily, until a
      chance dispelled them. <a name="IIchap9" id="IIchap9"></a><span
      class="chapnum">9</span>Galba had entrusted the government of Galatia and
      <a name="1fnm223"></a>Pamphylia<a href="#1fn223" class="fnnum">223</a> to
      Calpurnius Asprenas, who had been granted an escort of two triremes from
      the fleet at Misenum. It so happened that with these he touched at
      Cythnus. The rebels lost no time in appealing to the ship's captains in
      the name of Nero. The pretender, assuming an air of melancholy, appealed
      to 'the loyalty of his former soldiers', and begged them to establish him
      in Syria or Egypt. The captains either from sympathy or guile alleged that
      they must talk to their men, and would come back when they had prepared
      all their minds. However, they faithfully made a full report to Asprenas,
      on whose instructions they boarded the ship and killed the impostor,
      whoever he was. The man's eyes and hair and ferocious look were so
      remarkable that the body was carried into Asia and thence to Rome.

      country so divided and tossed by frequent change of rulers between liberty
      and licence even small events caused serious disturbance. It happened that
      Vibius <a name="1fnm224"></a>Crispus,<a href="#1fn224" class="fnnum">224</a>
      a man whose wealth, influence, and ability had won him a reputation that
      was great rather than good, had impeached before the senate a man of
      equestrian rank, called Annius Faustus, who <a name="1page119"></a><span
      class="pagenum">119</span>had been a professional informer under Nero. The
      senate had recently in Galba's principate passed a resolution authorizing
      the prosecution of informers. This resolution had been variously applied
      from time to time, and interpreted rigorously or leniently according as
      the defendant was helpless or influential. But it still retained some
      terrors. Crispus, moreover, had exerted all his powers to secure the
      conviction of the man who had informed against his <a name="1fnm225"></a>brother.<a
      href="#1fn225" class="fnnum">225</a> He had, in fact, induced a large
      proportion of the senate to demand that Faustus should be sent to
      execution undefended and unheard. However, with others, the defendant
      gained a great advantage from his prosecutor's undue influence. 'We must
      give him time,' they argued, 'the charges must be published: however
      hateful the criminal his case must be properly heard.' At first this
      advice prevailed. The trial was postponed for a few days. At length came
      the conviction of Faustus, which aroused in the country less satisfaction
      than his vile character warranted. People recalled the fact that Crispus
      himself had turned informer with pecuniary profit. It was not the penalty
      but the prosecutor that was unpopular.

    <p>
      <a name="IIchap11" id="IIchap11"></a><span class="chapnum">11</span>Meanwhile
      the war opened successfully for Otho. At his order the armies of Dalmatia
      and Pannonia started from their base. They comprised four <a name="1fnm226"></a>legions,<a
      href="#1fn226" class="fnnum">226</a> <a name="1page120"></a><span
      class="pagenum">120</span>each of which had sent forward detachments two
      thousand strong. The rest followed at a short interval: the Seventh legion
      raised by <a name="1fnm227"></a>Galba,<a href="#1fn227" class="fnnum">227</a>
      the Eleventh and Thirteenth, both composed of veteran troops, and the
      Fourteenth, which had won great distinction by crushing the rebellion in
      Britain.<a name="1fnm228"></a><a href="#1fn228" class="fnnum">228</a> Nero
      had further increased their glory by choosing them for special <a
      name="1fnm229"></a>service,<a href="#1fn229" class="fnnum">229</a> which
      accounts for their lasting loyalty to Nero and their keen support of Otho.
      But the stronger their numbers the greater their self-confidence and the
      slower their march. The cavalry and auxiliaries preceded the main body of
      the legions. From Rome itself came no mean force, five regiments of Guards
      with some detachments of cavalry and the First <a name="1fnm230"></a>legion.<a
      href="#1fn230" class="fnnum">230</a> To these were added an irregular
      force of 2,000 <a name="1fnm231"></a>gladiators,<a href="#1fn231"
      class="fnnum">231</a> a shameful assistance of which during the civil wars
      even strict generals availed themselves. Annius Gallus was placed in
      command of these forces with Vestricius <a name="1fnm232"></a>Spurinna,<a
      href="#1fn232" class="fnnum">232</a> and they were sent forward to hold
      the line of the Po. Their first plans had failed, <a name="1page121"></a><span
      class="pagenum">121</span>Caecina, whom Otho had hoped to hold within the
      Gallic provinces, having already crossed the <a name="1fnm233"></a>Alps.<a
      href="#1fn233" class="fnnum">233</a> Under Otho's personal command marched
      picked detachments of his Body Guard and the rest of the Household troops,
      together with reservists of the Guard and a large force of <a
      name="1fnm234"></a>marines.<a href="#1fn234" class="fnnum">234</a> He let
      no luxury either delay or disgrace his march. In an iron breast-plate he
      marched on foot at the head of his troops, looking rough and dishevelled,
      quite unlike his reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortune smiled on his first efforts. <a name="IIchap12" id="IIchap12"></a><span
      class="chapnum">12</span>By sea his fleet held most of the Italian coast
      right up to the foot of the Maritime Alps. To secure these mountains and
      attack the province of Narbonese Gaul he had placed in command Suedius
      Clemens, Antonius Novellus, and Aemilius <a name="1fnm235"></a>Pacensis.<a
      href="#1fn235" class="fnnum">235</a> Pacensis, however, was made a
      prisoner by his mutinous troops: Novellus had no authority: Clemens'
      command rested on popularity, and he was as greedy of battle as he was
      criminally blind to insubordination. No one could have imagined they were
      in Italy, on the soil of their native land. As though on foreign shores
      and among an enemy's towns, they burnt, ravaged, plundered, with results
      all the more horrible since no precautions had been taken against danger.
      The fields were full, the houses open. The inhabitants came to meet them
      with their wives and children, and were lured by the security <a
      name="1page122"></a><span class="pagenum">122</span>of peace into all the
      horrors of war. The Governor of the Maritime <a name="1fnm236"></a>Alps<a
      href="#1fn236" class="fnnum">236</a> at that time was Marius Maturus. He
      summoned the inhabitants, whose fighting strength was ample, and proposed
      to resist at the frontier the Othonians' invasion of the province. But at
      the first engagement the mountaineers were cut down and dispersed. They
      had assembled in random haste; they knew nothing of military service or
      discipline, nothing of the glory of victory or the disgrace of flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap13" id="IIchap13"></a><span class="chapnum">13</span>Enraged
      by this engagement, Otho's troops visited their indignation on the town of
      <a name="1fnm237"></a>Albintimilium.<a href="#1fn237" class="fnnum">237</a>
      The battle had brought them no booty, for the peasants were poor and their
      armour worthless, and being swift of foot, with a good knowledge of the
      country, they had escaped capture. However, the soldiers sated their greed
      at the expense of the innocent town. A Ligurian woman afforded a fine
      example of courage which made their conduct the more odious. She had
      concealed her son, and when the soldiers, who believed that she had hidden
      some money as well, demanded from her under torture where she was keeping
      him concealed, she pointed to her belly and replied, 'He is in hiding.' No
      subsequent tortures nor even death itself could bring her to change that
      brave and noble answer.

      <a name="IIchap14" id="IIchap14"></a><span class="chapnum">14</span>Panic-stricken
      couriers brought to Fabius Valens the news that Otho's fleet was
      threatening the province of Narbonese Gaul, which had sworn allegiance to
      Vitellius. Representatives from the Roman colonies also arrived beseeching
      his aid. He dispatched two cohorts of the <a name="1fnm238"></a>Tungri<a
      href="#1fn238" class="fnnum">238</a> and four troops of horse, together
      with the entire cavalry regiment of the <a name="1fnm239"></a>Treviri.<a
      href="#1fn239" class="fnnum">239</a> This force was put under the command
      of Julius <a name="1fnm240"></a>Classicus,<a href="#1fn240" class="fnnum">240</a>
      and part of it was detained in the colony of Forum <a name="1fnm241"></a>Julii,<a
      href="#1fn241" class="fnnum">241</a> since if the whole force marched
      inland and the sea-board were left unprotected Otho's fleet would swoop
      down at once. Twelve troops of cavalry and a picked body of auxiliaries
      marched against the enemy: these were reinforced by a Ligurian cohort
      which had long garrisoned this district, and a draft of five hundred
      Pannonian recruits who had not yet joined their legion.<a name="1fnm242"></a><a
      href="#1fn242" class="fnnum">242</a> The engagement began promptly. Their
      line was so arranged that some of the marines, reinforced by the peasants,
      held the rising ground by the sea, while the Guards filled the level space
      between the hills and the shore. The fleet, acting in conjunction with the
      land force, was ready to play its part in the battle, and extended a
      threatening front facing the coast. The Vitellians, weaker in infantry,
      put their <a name="1page124"></a><span class="pagenum">124</span>trust in
      their horse. The <a name="1fnm243"></a>mountaineers<a href="#1fn243"
      class="fnnum">243</a> were posted on the neighbouring heights, and the
      auxiliaries massed in close order behind the cavalry. The Treviran cavalry
      rashly charged the enemy, and meeting Otho's guards in front were
      simultaneously assailed in the flank by the peasants, flinging stones.
      This they could do well enough; and, drafted among the regulars, they all,
      bold and timid alike, showed the same courage in the hour of victory.
      Panic struck the defeated Vitellians when the fleet began to harass their
      rear. They were now surrounded, and would have been entirely destroyed had
      not darkness arrested the victors and sheltered their flight. <a
      name="IIchap15" id="IIchap15"></a><span class="chapnum">15</span>But
      though beaten the Vitellians were not cowed. Calling up reinforcements,
      they suddenly attacked while the unsuspecting enemy were taking their ease
      after the victory. They killed the pickets, broke into the camp and
      terrified the sailors. In time the panic subsided. The Othonians seized a
      hill, defended their position, and eventually assumed the offensive. The
      slaughter was frightful. The officers commanding the Tungri, after a long
      defence of their position, fell beneath a shower of weapons. The victory
      also cost the Othonians heavy loss, for the enemy's cavalry rallied and
      cut off all who rashly ventured too far in pursuit. So they agreed to a
      sort of armistice. As a safeguard against sudden raids either by the fleet
      on the one side or the cavalry on the other, the Vitellians retired to
      Antipolis,<a name="1fnm244"></a><a href="#1fn244" class="fnnum">244</a> a
      <a name="1page125"></a><span class="pagenum">125</span>town of the
      Narbonese province, and the Othonians to <a name="1fnm245"></a>Albingaunum<a
      href="#1fn245" class="fnnum">245</a> in the interior of Liguria.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap16" id="IIchap16"></a><span class="chapnum">16</span>The
      fame of this naval victory kept Corsica and Sardinia and the adjacent
      islands faithful to Otho's cause. However, Decumus Pacarius, the <a
      name="1fnm246"></a>procurator,<a href="#1fn246" class="fnnum">246</a>
      nearly ruined Corsica by an act of indiscretion, which in a war of such
      dimensions could not possibly have affected the issue, and only ended in
      his own destruction. He hated Otho and determined to aid Vitellius with
      all the forces of Corsica; a useless assistance, even if it had been
      forthcoming. He summoned the chief men of the island and disclosed his
      project. Claudius Pyrrhicus, who commanded the Liburnian <a name="1fnm247"></a>cruisers<a
      href="#1fn247" class="fnnum">247</a> stationed there, and a Roman knight
      named <a name="1page126"></a><span class="pagenum">126</span>Quintius
      Certus ventured to oppose him. He ordered their execution. This overawed
      the others who were present. So they swore allegiance to Vitellius, as did
      also the general mass of ignorant people, who blindly shared a fear they
      did not feel. However, when Pacarius began to enlist them and to harass
      his undisciplined men with military duties, their loathing for the
      unwonted labour set them thinking of their weakness. 'They lived in an
      island: Vitellius' legions were in Germany, a long way off: Otho's fleet
      had already sacked and plundered districts that had even horse and foot to
      protect them.' The revulsion was sudden, but did not issue in overt
      resistance. They chose a suitable moment for their treachery. Waiting till
      Pacarius' <a name="1fnm248"></a>visitors<a href="#1fn248" class="fnnum">248</a>
      were gone, they murdered him, stripped and helpless, in his bath, and
      killed his comrades too. The heads they bore themselves to Otho, like
      enemies' scalps. Neither did Otho reward nor Vitellius punish them. In the
      general confusion their deed was overshadowed by more heinous crimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap17" id="IIchap17"></a><span class="chapnum">17</span>We
      have already <a name="1fnm249"></a>described<a href="#1fn249" class="fnnum">249</a>
      how 'Silius' Horse' had admitted the war into the heart of Italy. No one
      there either supported Otho or preferred Vitellius. But prolonged peace
      had broken their spirits to utter servility. They were an easy prey to the
      first comer and cared little who was the better man. All the fields and
      cities between the Alps and the Po, the most fertile district in Italy,
      were held by the Vitellian forces, the cohorts sent forward by Caecina<a
      href="#1fn249" class="fnnum">249</a> <a name="1page127"></a><span
      class="pagenum">127</span>having already arrived. One of the Pannonian
      cohorts had been captured at Cremona: a hundred cavalry and a thousand
      marines had been cut off between Placentia and Ticinum.<a name="1fnm250"></a><a
      href="#1fn250" class="fnnum">250</a> After this success the river and its
      steep banks were no barrier to the Vitellian troops: indeed the Batavians
      and other Germans found the Po a positive temptation. Crossing suddenly
      opposite Placentia, they captured a handful of scouts and created such a
      panic that the others in terror spread the false report that Caecina's
      whole army was upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap18" id="IIchap18"></a><span class="chapnum">18</span>Spurinna,
      who was holding Placentia, had made up his mind that Caecina had not yet
      arrived, and that, if he should, his troops must be kept within their
      lines: he could not pit three cohorts of guards with one detachment a
      thousand <a name="1fnm251"></a>strong,<a href="#1fn251" class="fnnum">251</a>
      and a few cavalry, against Caecina's veteran army. But his men were unruly
      and ignorant of <a name="1fnm252"></a>war.<a href="#1fn252" class="fnnum">252</a>
      Seizing the standards and <a name="1fnm253"></a>colours<a href="#1fn253"
      class="fnnum">253</a> they broke out, threatening to kill the general who
      tried to check them and paying no heed to their superior officers. They
      even clamoured that Otho was being betrayed, and Caecina had been <a
      name="1fnm254"></a>summoned.<a href="#1fn254" class="fnnum">254</a>
      Spurinna yielded unwillingly to their folly, at first under compulsion,
      later with a show of <a name="1page128"></a><span class="pagenum">128</span>sympathy.
      He was anxious to gain weight for his advice, should the mutiny cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap19" id="IIchap19"></a><span class="chapnum">19</span>At
      nightfall, with the Po in sight, Spurinna decided to entrench his <a
      name="1fnm255"></a>camp.<a href="#1fn255" class="fnnum">255</a> The
      unaccustomed hard work soon blunted the enthusiasm of his town-bred
      troops. The older men began to curse their credulity, and to point out the
      fearful danger to their small force of being surrounded by Caecina's army
      in the open country. Soon a more sober spirit pervaded the camp. The
      tribunes and centurions mingled with the men, and every one talked with
      admiration of Spurinna's foresight in selecting a powerful and wealthy
      colony as a strong base for their operations. Finally Spurinna himself
      rather explained his plans than reproached their faults, and, leaving
      patrols behind, succeeded eventually in leading the rest of the men back
      to Placentia in a quieter and more submissive frame of mind. There the
      walls were repaired, outworks built, and the turrets increased in height
      and number, while Spurinna provided not only for arms and ammunition but
      also for obedience and discipline. This was all his party lacked, for
      their courage was unimpeachable.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap20" id="IIchap20"></a><span class="chapnum">20</span>Caecina,
      on the other hand, seemed to have left <a name="1page129"></a><span
      class="pagenum">129</span>his cruelty and profligacy on the other side of
      the Alps. He marched through Italy with a well-disciplined force. The
      people in the country-towns and colonies took offence at his costume as
      showing arrogance. While they wore the plain toga, Caecina addressed them
      attired in a parti-coloured plaid and <a name="1fnm256"></a>trousers.<a
      href="#1fn256" class="fnnum">256</a> Moreover, his wife Salonina rode on a
      fine horse with purple trappings, and though this did no one any harm,
      they grumbled and seemed hurt. It is an ineradicable human trait to turn
      critical eyes on new-found fortune, and to insist upon moderation most of
      all in those who used to be our equals. Crossing the Po, Caecina tried to
      undermine the loyalty of the Othonians by negotiations and promises. They
      retaliated with the same weapons, and when they had finished bandying
      empty and fine-sounding phrases about Peace and Union, Caecina devoted all
      his attention and plans to an assault on Placentia in terrific force. He
      knew that his future reputation rested on the issue of his first
      engagements.<a name="1fnm257"></a><a href="#1fn257" class="fnnum">257</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap21" id="IIchap21"></a><span class="chapnum">21</span>But
      the first day's work savoured more of impatience than of a veteran army's
      methods. The men ventured under the walls without cover or precaution,
      drunk and overfed. Meanwhile the amphitheatre, a fine <a name="1page130"></a><span
      class="pagenum">130</span>building outside the walls, was burnt down. It
      was set on fire either by the attacking force hurling torches and heated
      shot and fire-brands, or by the besieged in returning their fire. The
      common people of the town harboured a suspicion that fuel for the fire had
      been surreptitiously introduced from one of the neighbouring colonies, and
      that the motive was jealousy, since no building in Italy could hold so
      many people. However it happened, they thought little of it, while worse
      disasters threatened: safety assured, they bewailed it as the worst
      calamity they could have suffered. To return, however, to Caecina: he was
      repulsed with heavy losses, and the night was spent in preparations. The
      Vitellians provided mantlets, fascines, and <a name="1fnm258"></a>penthouses,<a
      href="#1fn258" class="fnnum">258</a> to protect the assailants while
      undermining the walls: the Othonians procured stakes and huge masses of
      stone or lead or brass, to break through the enemy's formation and crush
      them to pieces. Both parties were actuated by feelings of pride and
      ambition. Various encouragements were used, one side praising the strength
      of the legions and the German army, the other the reputation of the Guards
      and the City Garrison. The Vitellians decried their enemy as lazy
      effeminates demoralized by the circus and the theatre: to which they
      replied that the Vitellians were a pack of foreigners and barbarians. <a
      name="1page131"></a><span class="pagenum">131</span>Meanwhile, Otho and
      Vitellius were held up to praise or blame, insult providing the more
      fruitful stimulus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap22" id="IIchap22"></a><span class="chapnum">22</span>Hardly
      had day dawned before the walls of Placentia bristled with defenders, and
      the fields glittered with the soldiers' armour. The Vitellian <a
      name="1fnm259"></a>legions<a href="#1fn259" class="fnnum">259</a>
      advancing in close order with their auxiliaries in scattered bands
      assailed the higher portions of the walls with stones and arrows: where
      the walls were in disrepair or crumbling from age they came close up to
      them. The Othonians above, poising and aiming their weapons with surer
      effect, rained them down on the Germans, who came rashly charging under
      the walls with the wild songs and scanty dress of their country,
      brandishing their shields over their heads. Meanwhile, the legionaries
      under cover of their mantlets and fascines set to work to undermine the
      walls, build up a mound, and assail the gates, while Otho's Guards rolled
      on to them with terrific crashes huge millstones, which they had arranged
      for this purpose along the walls. Of those beneath, some were crushed by
      the stones; others, wounded by darts, were left mangled and bleeding to
      death. Panic redoubled the slaughter, and the rain of missiles came all
      the fiercer from the walls. At last they sacrificed the honour of their
      party and beat a retreat. Caecina, ashamed of his rash attempt at assault,
      was afraid of looking ridiculous and useless if he sat still in the same
      camp. So he crossed the Po <a name="1page132"></a><span class="pagenum">132</span>and
      made for Cremona. As he was retiring, Turullius Cerialis with a large
      force of marines, and Julius <a name="1fnm260"></a>Briganticus<a
      href="#1fn260" class="fnnum">260</a> with a few cavalry, came over to his
      side. The latter, a Batavian born, had held a cavalry command: the former
      was a senior centurion, who was known to Caecina, as he had served in that
      capacity in Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap23" id="IIchap23"></a><span class="chapnum">23</span>Spurinna,
      learning the enemy's route, informed Annius <a name="1fnm261"></a>Gallus<a
      href="#1fn261" class="fnnum">261</a> by letter of all that had happened,
      the defence of Placentia and Caecina's plans. Gallus was leading the First
      legion to the relief of Placentia, for he doubted the ability of the weak
      force of Guards to resist a long siege and the full strength of the German
      army. Hearing that Caecina was defeated and making for Cremona, he halted
      at Bedriacum, though he found it hard to restrain the ardour of his
      troops, whose zeal for battle nearly broke into mutiny. The village of
      Bedriacum lies between Verona and Cremona,<a name="1fnm262"></a><a
      href="#1fn262" class="fnnum">262</a> and two Roman disasters have now
      given it a sinister notoriety.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same week Martius <a name="1fnm263"></a>Macer<a href="#1fn263"
      class="fnnum">263</a> gained a victory in the neighbourhood of Cremona.
      With great enterprise he had transported his gladiators across the Po, and
      suddenly flung them on to the opposite bank. There <a name="1page133"></a><span
      class="pagenum">133</span>they routed the Vitellian auxiliaries and killed
      all who offered resistance, the rest taking flight to Cremona. But Macer
      checked their victorious ardour, for fear that the enemy might be
      reinforced and reverse the fortune of the battle. This aroused suspicion
      among the Othonians, who put a bad construction on all that their generals
      did. All the least courageous and most impudent of the troops vied
      incessantly with each other in bringing various charges against Annius
      Gallus, Suetonius Paulinus, and Marius Celsus, for the two latter had also
      been placed in command by <a name="1fnm264"></a>Otho.<a href="#1fn264"
      class="fnnum">264</a> The most energetic in promoting mutiny and
      dissension were Galba's murderers, who, maddened by their feelings of fear
      and of guilt, created endless disorder, sometimes talking open sedition,
      sometimes sending anonymous letters to Otho. As he always believed men of
      the meaner sort and distrusted patriots, he now wavered nervously, being
      always irresolute in success and firmer in the face of danger. He
      therefore sent for his brother <a name="1fnm265"></a>Titianus<a
      href="#1fn265" class="fnnum">265</a> and gave him the chief command.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap24" id="IIchap24"></a><span class="chapnum">24</span>Meanwhile
      success attended the generalship of Paulinus and Celsus.<a name="1fnm266"></a><a
      href="#1fn266" class="fnnum">266</a> Caecina was tortured by his constant
      failure and the waning reputation of his <a name="1page134"></a><span
      class="pagenum">134</span>army. Repulsed from Placentia, he had lately
      seen his auxiliaries defeated, and his patrols constantly worsted in
      skirmishes more frequent than memorable. Now that Fabius Valens was close
      at hand, he determined not to let all the glory of the war fall to him,
      and hastened with more zeal than prudence to retrieve his reputation.
      About twelve <a name="1fnm267"></a>miles<a href="#1fn267" class="fnnum">267</a>
      distant from Cremona, at a place called <i>Twin Brethren</i>,<a
      name="1fnm268"></a><a href="#1fn268" class="fnnum">268</a> he carefully
      concealed the bravest of his auxiliaries in a wood overlooking the road.
      The cavalry were ordered to ride forward down the road and provoke an
      engagement. They were then to feign flight and lure the pursuers on in hot
      haste until they fell into the ambush. This plan was betrayed to Otho's
      generals. Paulinus took charge of the infantry, Celsus of the horse. A
      detachment of the Thirteenth legion,<a name="1fnm269"></a><a href="#1fn269"
      class="fnnum">269</a> four auxiliary cohorts of foot, and five hundred
      cavalry were stationed on the left flank. Three cohorts of the Guards in
      column occupied the raised high-road.<a name="1fnm270"></a><a
      href="#1fn270" class="fnnum">270</a> On the right flank marched the First
      legion, two auxiliary cohorts of foot, and five hundred cavalry. Besides
      these they moved out a thousand cavalry&mdash;Guards and auxiliaries&mdash;as
      a reserve to crown their success, or assist them in difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap25" id="IIchap25"></a><span class="chapnum">25</span>Before
      they came to close quarters, the Vitellians began to retire. Celsus,
      forewarned of the ruse, <a name="1page135"></a><span class="pagenum">135</span>halted
      his men. Whereupon the Vitellians impatiently rose from their ambush and,
      while Celsus slowly retired, followed him further and further until they
      plunged headlong into an ambush themselves. The auxiliaries were on their
      flanks; the legions faced them in front; and the cavalry by a sudden man&oelig;uvre
      had closed in on their rear. However, Suetonius Paulinus did not
      immediately give the signal for his infantry to charge. He was by nature
      dilatory, and preferred cautiously reasoned measures to accidental
      success. He kept on issuing orders about filling up the ditches, clearing
      the fields and extending the line, convinced that it was soon enough to
      play for victory when he had taken every precaution against defeat. This
      delay gave the Vitellians time to take refuge in the vineyards, where the
      interlaced vine-stems made it hard to follow. Adjoining these was a little
      wood, from under cover of which they ventured another sally and killed the
      foremost of the Guards' cavalry. There Prince <a name="1fnm271"></a>Epiphanes<a
      href="#1fn271" class="fnnum">271</a> was wounded, while making vigorous
      efforts to rally Otho's forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap26" id="IIchap26"></a><span class="chapnum">26</span>At
      this point Otho's infantry charged, crushed the opposing line, and even
      routed the troops who were hurrying up in support. For Caecina had brought
      up his reinforcements not all at once but in separate detachments. These,
      arriving in scattered units, and never in sufficient force, only added to
      the confusion, since the panic of the rout infected them as well. <a
      name="1page136"></a><span class="pagenum">136</span>Mutiny, too, broke out
      in the camp, because the troops were not all taken into battle. Julius
      Gratus, the camp-prefect, was put in irons on a charge of plotting with
      his brother, who was fighting on Otho's side. It was known that the
      Othonians had arrested the brother, Julius Fronto, on the same charge. For
      the rest, such was the universal panic among pursuers and pursued, on the
      field and in the camp, that it was commonly said on both sides that, if
      Suetonius Paulinus had not sounded the retreat, Caecina's whole army might
      have been destroyed. Paulinus maintained that he avoided any excessive
      strain of work or marching, for fear of exposing his exhausted troops to a
      counter-attack from the Vitellians in the camp, who were still fresh for
      battle: besides, he had no reserves to fall back on in case of defeat. A
      few approved of the general's strategy, but the common opinion was
      adverse.<a name="1fnm272"></a><a href="#1fn272" class="fnnum">272</a>

          to compensate for his declaration of the independence of Achaia.
          Vespasian once more transferred it to imperial government. If <i>procurator</i>
          is correct here, Pacarius must have been a subordinate imperial
          functionary in a senatorial province. As the province changed hands so
          often and was so soon after this placed under imperial control, it is
          possible that Tacitus made a mistake and that Pacarius was an
          ex-praetor. Those who feel that Tacitus is unlikely to have made this
          error, and that Pacarius can hardly have been anything but governor,
          adopt the suggestion that Corsica did not share the fate of Sardinia
          in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 67, but remained under the control
          of an imperial procurator. There is no clear evidence of this, but

      <a name="IIchap27" id="IIchap27"></a><span class="chapnum">27</span>This
      reverse reduced the Vitellians not to despair but to discipline. Not only
      was this the case in Caecina's camp, who blamed his men as being readier
      for mutiny than for battle, but the troops under Fabius Valens, who had
      now reached <a name="1fnm273"></a>Ticinum,<a href="#1fn273" class="fnnum">273</a>
      lost their contempt for the enemy, conceived a desire to <a name="1page137"></a><span
      class="pagenum">137</span>retrieve their glory, and offered their general
      a more respectful and steady obedience. There had, indeed, been a serious
      outbreak of mutiny, the account of which I may now resume from an earlier
      <a name="1fnm274"></a>chapter,<a href="#1fn274" class="fnnum">274</a>
      where it seemed wrong to break the narrative of Caecina's operations. The
      Batavian auxiliaries, who had left the Fourteenth legion during the war
      against , heard of Vitellius' rising while on their way to Britain, and,
      as I have already <a name="1fnm275"></a>described,<a href="#1fn275"
      class="fnnum">275</a> joined Fabius Valens in the country of the Lingones.
      There they grew insolent. Whenever they passed the tents of the Roman
      soldiers, they boasted loudly that they had coerced the Fourteenth, had
      deprived Nero of Italy, and held the whole issue of the war in the hollow
      of their hand. This insulted the soldiers and annoyed the general; brawls
      and quarrels ruined good discipline. Ultimately Valens began to suspect
      that their insubordination meant treachery. <a name="IIchap28"
      id="IIchap28"></a><span class="chapnum">28</span>Accordingly, on receiving
      the news that Otho's fleet had defeated the Treviran <a name="1fnm276"></a>cavalry<a
      href="#1fn276" class="fnnum">276</a> and the Tungri, and was now
      blockading Narbonese Gaul, he determined at the same time to assist his
      allies, and by a stroke of generalship to separate contingents that were
      so insubordinate and, if united, so strong. He therefore ordered the
      Batavians to march to the support of Narbo. Immediately this order became
      generally known, the auxiliaries began to complain and the legionaries to
      chafe. 'They were being deprived of their strongest support: here were
      these invincible veterans promptly withdrawn <a name="1page138"></a><span
      class="pagenum">138</span>directly the enemy came in sight: if the
      province was more important than the safety of Rome and the empire, why
      not all go there? but if Italy was the corner-stone of their success, he
      ought not as it were to amputate their strongest limb.'<a name="1fnm277"></a><a
      href="#1fn277" class="fnnum">277</a> <a name="IIchap29" id="IIchap29"></a><span
      class="chapnum">29</span>In answer to this presumptuous criticism, Valens
      loosed his lictors upon them and set to work to check the mutiny. They
      attacked their general, stoned him, and chased him out of the camp,
      shouting that he was concealing the spoils of Gaul and the gold from <a
      name="1fnm278"></a>Vienne,<a href="#1fn278" class="fnnum">278</a> the due
      reward of their labours. They looted the baggage, ransacked the general's
      quarters, and even rummaged in the ground with javelins and lances.
      Valens, in slave's dress, took refuge with a cavalry officer. Gradually
      the disorder began to die down. Alfenus Varus, the camp-prefect, then hit
      upon the plan of forbidding the centurions to go the rounds or to have the
      bugle sounded to summon the men to their duties. No one had anything to
      do: they eyed each other in astonishment, dismayed above all at having no
      one to command them. At first by silent submission, at last with tearful
      prayers, they sought pardon. Valens appeared, haggard and in tears, but
      above all expectation safe and sound,&mdash;joy, sympathy, cheers! With a
      wild revulsion of feeling&mdash;mobs are always extravagant&mdash;they
      made a ring round him with the eagles and standards, and carried him to
      the Tribunal with loud praises and congratulations. With wise moderation
      he demanded <a name="1page139"></a><span class="pagenum">139</span>no
      punishment, but, to disarm suspicion of his good faith, he criticized one
      or two of them <a name="1fnm279"></a>severely.<a href="#1fn279"
      class="fnnum">279</a> He was well aware that in civil war the men are
      allowed more licence than their officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap30" id="IIchap30"></a><span class="chapnum">30</span>While
      they were entrenching themselves at Ticinum they heard the news of
      Caecina's defeat, and the mutiny nearly broke out afresh: Valens, they
      thought, had treacherously delayed in order to keep them out of the
      battle. They refused rest, would not wait for the general, marched on in
      front of the standards, hurrying on the bearers, and by a forced march
      joined Caecina. Valens had a bad name with Caecina's army. They complained
      that despite their greatly inferior numbers he had exposed them to the
      full force of the enemy. At the same time, for fear of being despised as
      defeated cowards, they excused themselves by exaggerating the strength of
      the new arrivals. In fact, though Valens' numbers were larger, and he had
      almost twice as many legionaries and auxiliaries as <a name="1fnm280"></a>Caecina,<a
      href="#1fn280" class="fnnum">280</a> yet it was Caecina who enjoyed the
      confidence of the men. Apart from his kindness, in which he seemed much
      readier than Valens, they admired him for his youthful vigour and
      commanding <a name="1fnm281"></a>stature,<a href="#1fn281" class="fnnum">281</a>
      and liked him too without exactly knowing why. So there was rivalry
      between the generals. Caecina mocked at Valens for <a name="1page140"></a><span
      class="pagenum">140</span>his dirty and dishonest ways:<a name="1fnm282"></a><a
      href="#1fn282" class="fnnum">282</a> Valens at Caecina's pompous vanity.
      But they smothered their dislike and worked together for a common end,
      writing frequent letters in which they sacrificed all hope of pardon and
      heaped abuse on Otho. Otho's generals refrained from retaliating upon
      Vitellius, though his character offered richer scope. <a name="IIchap31"
      id="IIchap31"></a><span class="chapnum">31</span>In death Otho earned a
      noble name and Vitellius infamy, yet at this time people were more afraid
      of Otho's burning passions than of Vitellius' listless luxury. The murder
      of Galba had made Otho feared and hated, while no one attributed to
      Vitellius the outbreak of the war. It was felt that Vitellius' gluttony
      was a personal disgrace: Otho's excesses, his cruelty and his daring,
      spelt more danger to the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that Caecina and Valens had joined forces, the Vitellians had no
      longer any reason to avoid a decisive battle. Otho accordingly held a
      council to decide whether they should prolong the war or put their fortune
      to the test. <a name="IIchap32" id="IIchap32"></a><span class="chapnum">32</span>Suetonius
      Paulinus, who was considered the most experienced general of his <a
      name="1fnm283"></a>day,<a href="#1fn283" class="fnnum">283</a> now felt it
      was due to his reputation to deliver his views on the general conduct of
      the war. His contention was that the enemy's interests were best served by
      haste, Otho's by delay. He argued thus: 'The whole of Vitellius' force has
      now arrived and he has <a name="1page141"></a><span class="pagenum">141</span>few
      reinforcements in his rear, for the Gallic provinces are in a ferment, and
      it would be fatal to abandon the Rhine with all those hostile tribes ready
      to swarm across it. The troops in Britain are busy with their own foes and
      cut off by the sea: the Spanish provinces can scarcely spare any troops:
      the Narbonese are seriously alarmed by their recent reverse and the
      inroads of our fleet. The country across the Po is shut in by the Alps and
      denied all supplies by <a name="1fnm284"></a>sea,<a href="#1fn284"
      class="fnnum">284</a> and, besides, its resources have been already
      exhausted by the passage of their army. Nowhere can they get supplies, and
      without commissariat no army can be kept together. The German troops are
      their strongest fighting arm, but their constitutions will not be strong
      enough to stand the change of weather, if we protract the war into the
      summer. It has often happened that a force, which seemed irresistible at
      first, has dwindled to nothing through the tedium of forced inaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      'On the other hand, our resources are rich and reliable. We have on our
      side Pannonia, Moesia, Dalmatia, and the East; the armies there are fresh
      and strong; we have Italy and Rome, the Queen of the World, and the Roman
      Senate and People: those titles always mean something, though their glory
      may sometimes be obscured. We have large public and private resources, and
      in civil war a vast quantity of money is stronger than the sword. Our
      soldiers are inured to the Italian climate or, at any rate, to heat. We
      are <a name="1page142"></a><span class="pagenum">142</span>entrenched
      behind the Po:<a name="1fnm285"></a><a href="#1fn285" class="fnnum">285</a>
      its cities are protected by strong walls and willing hands, and the
      defence of Placentia has shown that none of them will yield to the enemy.'
      Therefore Otho must remain on the defensive. In a few days the Fourteenth
      legion would arrive: its fame alone was great, and the Moesian <a
      name="1fnm286"></a>forces<a href="#1fn286" class="fnnum">286</a> would be
      with it. He should, at any rate, postpone his deliberations until then,
      and fight, if fight he must, with augmented strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap33" id="IIchap33"></a><span class="chapnum">33</span>Marius
      Celsus supported Paulinus. Annius Gallus had been hurt a few days before
      by a fall from his horse, but messengers were sent to inquire his views,
      and they reported that he too agreed. Otho inclined to a decisive
      engagement. His brother Titianus and Proculus, the prefect of the Guard,
      with all the impatience of inexperience, stoutly maintained that fortune
      and Providence, and Otho's own good genius inspired his policy, and would
      inspire its performance. They had descended to flattery by way of checking
      opposition. When it was decided to take the offensive, the question arose
      whether Otho in person should take part in the battle or hold himself in
      reserve. His evil counsellors again carried their point. Otho was to
      retire to <a name="1fnm287"></a>Brixellum,<a href="#1fn287" class="fnnum">287</a>
      and, by withdrawing from the <a name="1page143"></a><span class="pagenum">143</span>hazards
      of the field, reserve himself for the supreme control of the campaign and
      of the empire. To this Paulinus and Celsus offered no further opposition,
      for fear of seeming to endanger the person of their prince. From this day
      dates the decline of Otho's party. Not only did he take with him a
      considerable force of the Guards, Body Guard, and cavalry, but the spirit
      of the troops who remained behind was broken. The men trusted no one but
      Otho, and Otho no one but the men. His generals were under suspicion and
      their authority left in doubt.<a name="1fnm288"></a><a href="#1fn288"
      class="fnnum">288</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap34" id="IIchap34"></a><span class="chapnum">34</span>None
      of these arrangements failed to reach the ears of the Vitellians.
      Desertions were frequent, as they always are in civil war, and the scouts
      in their eagerness to discover the enemy's plans always failed to conceal
      their own. Caecina and Valens, counting on the fatal impatience of the
      enemy, remained quietly on their guard to see what they would do: for it
      is always wisdom to profit by another's folly. Feigning an intention of
      crossing the Po, they began to construct a bridge, partly as a
      demonstration against the <a name="1fnm289"></a>gladiators<a href="#1fn289"
      class="fnnum">289</a> on the opposite bank, partly to find something for
      their idle troops to do. Boats were placed at equal intervals with their
      heads up stream and fastened together by strong wooden planks. They also
      cast anchors from them to ensure the solidity of the <a name="1page144"></a><span
      class="pagenum">144</span>bridge, but they allowed the hawsers to drift
      slack, so that when the river rose the boats might all rise with it
      without the line being broken. To guard the bridge a high tower was built
      out on the end boat, from which they could repulse the enemy with various
      artillery. Meanwhile the Othonians had built a tower on the bank and kept
      up a steady shower of stones and torches.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap35" id="IIchap35"></a><span class="chapnum">35</span>In
      midstream there was an island, to which the gladiators tried to make their
      way in boats, but the Germans swam over and got there first. When a good
      number of them had swam across, Macer manned some Liburnian <a
      name="1fnm290"></a>cruisers<a href="#1fn290" class="fnnum">290</a> and
      attacked them with the bravest of his gladiators. But they fought with
      less courage than soldiers, and from their unsteady boats they could not
      shoot so well as the others, who had a firm footing on the bank. Swaying
      this way and that in their alarm, the sailors and the marines were
      beginning to get in each other's way, when the Germans actually leapt into
      the shallows, caught hold of the boats by the stern, and either clambered
      up by the gangways or sunk them bodily with their own hands. All this took
      place before the eyes of both <a name="1fnm291"></a>armies<a href="#1fn291"
      class="fnnum">291</a>, and the higher rose the spirits of the Vitellians,
      the greater became the indignation of the Othonians against Macer, the
      author and cause of their disaster. <a name="IIchap36" id="IIchap36"></a><span
      class="chapnum">36</span>The <a name="1page145"></a><span class="pagenum">145</span>remainder
      of the boats were eventually dragged <a name="1fnm292"></a>off,<a
      href="#1fn292" class="fnnum">292</a> and the battle ended in flight. The
      army demanded Macer's execution. He had been actually wounded by a lance
      that had been flung at him, and the soldiers were rushing on him with
      drawn swords when some tribunes and centurions intervened and rescued him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after this, Vestricius Spurinna, on Otho's orders, brought up a
      reinforcement of the Guards, leaving behind a small garrison at Placentia,
      and before long, Otho sent the consul-elect, Flavius Sabinus,<a
      name="1fnm293"></a><a href="#1fn293" class="fnnum">293</a> to take command
      of Macer's force. This change pleased the soldiers, but the frequent
      mutinies made the generals unwilling to assume such a perilous command.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap37" id="IIchap37"></a><span class="chapnum">37</span>In
      some of my <a name="1fnm294"></a>authorities<a href="#1fn294" class="fnnum">294</a>
      I find a statement that either a growing fear of war or dislike of the two
      emperors, whose discreditable misconduct grew daily more notorious, led
      the armies to hesitate whether they should not give up the struggle and
      either themselves combine to choose an emperor or refer the choice to the
      senate. This, it is suggested, was the motive of Otho's generals in
      advising delay, and Paulinus in particular had high hopes, since he was
      the senior ex-consul, and a distinguished general who <a name="1page146"></a><span
      class="pagenum">146</span>had earned a brilliant reputation by his
      operations in Britain. For my own part, while I am ready to admit that a
      few people may have tacitly wished for peace instead of civil war, or for
      a good and virtuous emperor instead of two who were the worst of
      criminals, yet I imagine that Paulinus was much too wise to hope that in a
      time of universal corruption the people would show such moderation. Those
      who had sacrificed peace in a passion for war were not likely to stop the
      war from any affection for peace. Nor was it possible that armies whose
      language and characteristics differed so widely should ever come to such
      an agreement. As for the officers; nearly all of them were extravagant,
      bankrupt, and guilty of some crime: they had not a good enough conscience
      to put up with any emperor who was not as vicious as themselves and under
      an obligation for their services.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap38" id="IIchap38"></a><span class="chapnum">38</span>The
      old ingrained human passion for power matured and burst into prominence
      with the growth of the empire. With straiter resources equality was easily
      preserved. But when once we had brought the world to our feet and
      exterminated every rival state or king, we were left free to covet power
      without fear of interruption. It was then that strife first broke out
      between patricians and plebeians: at one time arose seditious <a
      name="1fnm295"></a>tribunes,<a href="#1fn295" class="fnnum">295</a> at
      another tyrannous consuls:<a name="1fnm296"></a><a href="#1fn296"
      class="fnnum">296</a> <a name="1page147"></a><span class="pagenum">147</span>in
      the Forum at Rome were sown the first seeds of civil war. Before long,
      Marius, rising from the lowest ranks of the people, and Sulla, the most
      cruel of all the nobles, crushed our liberty by force of arms and
      substituted a despotism. Then came Pompey, whose aims, though less patent,
      were no better than theirs. From that time onwards the one end sought was
      supreme power in the state. Even at Pharsalia and Philippi the citizen
      armies did not lay down their arms. How then can we suppose that the
      troops of Otho and Vitellius would have willingly stopped the war? The
      same anger of heaven, the same human passions, the same criminal motives
      drove them into discord. True these wars were each settled by a single
      battle, but that was due to the generals' cowardice. However, my
      reflections on the ancient and the modern character have carried me too
      far: I must now resume the thread of our narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap39" id="IIchap39"></a><span class="chapnum">39</span>When
      Otho started for Brixellum, he left his brother Titianus in nominal
      command, though the real power lay with the prefect Proculus. As for
      Celsus and Paulinus, no use was made of their experience, and their empty
      titles were used as a screen for other people's blunders. The tribunes and
      centurions felt themselves in an ambiguous position, seeing the better
      generals sacrificed and the worst in command. The men were full of spirit,
      but preferred criticizing to carrying out their officers' orders. It was
      decided to advance and encamp four miles west of Bedriacum. <a
      name="1page148"></a><span class="pagenum">148</span>Though it was spring,
      and rivers abounded, the men were very foolishly allowed to suffer from
      want of water. Here a council of war was held, for Otho kept sending
      dispatches urging haste, and the soldiers kept clamouring for their
      emperor to lead them. Many demanded that the troops stationed across the
      <a name="1fnm297"></a>Po<a href="#1fn297" class="fnnum">297</a> should be
      brought up. It is not so easy to decide what was the best thing they could
      have done as to be sure that what they did do was the worst. <a
      name="IIchap40" id="IIchap40"></a><span class="chapnum">40</span>They were
      in marching order, not fighting trim, and their objective was the
      confluence of the Po and the <a name="1fnm298"></a>Arda,<a href="#1fn298"
      class="fnnum">298</a> sixteen miles away. Celsus and Paulinus refused to
      expose their troops, fatigued by the march and under heavy kit, to the
      assault of an enemy who, while still fresh after covering barely four
      miles, would certainly attack them, either while they were in the disorder
      of a marching column, or when they had broken up to dig trenches. However,
      Titianus and Proculus, worsted in argument, appealed to their authority:
      and there arrived post-haste a Numidian orderly with a peremptory dispatch
      from Otho, criticizing his generals' inaction, and ordering them to bring
      matters to a head. He was sick of delay and too impatient to live on hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1page149"></a><span class="pagenum">149</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap41" id="IIchap41"></a><span class="chapnum">41</span>On
      that same day, while Caecina was busy with the bridge-building <a
      name="1fnm299"></a>operations,<a href="#1fn299" class="fnnum">299</a> two
      officers of the Guards came and demanded an interview. He was preparing to
      hear and answer their proposals, when some scouts burst in with the news
      that the enemy were close at hand. The officers' conversation was thus
      interrupted, and it was left uncertain whether they were broaching a
      hostile plot or a piece of treachery, or some honest plan. Caecina,
      dismissing the officers, rode back to the camp, where he found that Valens
      had given orders to sound for battle, and the troops were already under
      arms. While the legions were balloting for the order in which they were to
      take the field, the cavalry rode out and charged. Strange to say, they
      would have been hurtled back upon the trenches by a smaller force of
      Othonians, had not the Italian legion bravely <a name="1page150"></a><span
      class="pagenum">150</span>stopped them by drawing their swords and forcing
      them to go back and resume the fight. The Vitellian legions formed without
      any disorder, for though the enemy were close at hand, thick plantations
      hid the approaching force. In the Othonian army the generals were nervous
      and the men ill-disposed towards them: their march was hindered by carts
      and camp-followers, and the high <a name="1fnm300"></a>road,<a
      href="#1fn300" class="fnnum">300</a> with its deep ditches on either side,
      was too narrow even for a peaceful march. Some of the men formed round
      their standards, others went searching for their place: on every side
      there was an uproar as men ran about shouting to each other: the boldest
      kept pressing on to the front, while the tide of the timid ebbed to the
      rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap42" id="IIchap42"></a><span class="chapnum">42</span>Amid
      the confusion of this sudden panic somebody invented a story that
      Vitellius' army had abandoned his cause, whereupon an unwarrantable glee
      relaxed their efforts. It was never fully known whether this report was
      spread by Vitellian scouts or whether it was started on Otho's side,
      either by treachery or chance. Losing all their thirst for battle the
      Othonians actually broke into a cheer. The enemy answered with angry
      shouts, and most of Otho's soldiers, having no idea what caused the
      cheering, feared treachery. At this point the Vitellian line charged. They
      were fresh, and in good order, stronger and more numerous. However, the
      Othonians, despite their disorder, fewer numbers, and fatigue, offered a
      stubborn resistance. The ground was encumbered with orchards and
      vineyards, <a name="1page151"></a><span class="pagenum">151</span>and the
      character of the battle varied accordingly. They fought now from a
      distance, now at close quarters, and charged sometimes in detachment,
      sometimes in <a name="1fnm301"></a>column.<a href="#1fn301" class="fnnum">301</a>
      On the raised high-road they fought hand to hand, using the weight of
      their bodies and their shields. They gave up throwing their javelins and
      cut through helmet and breastplate with sword and axe. Each man knew his
      foe; they were in view of the other troops;<a name="1fnm302"></a><a
      href="#1fn302" class="fnnum">302</a> and they fought as if the whole issue
      of the war depended on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap43" id="IIchap43"></a><span class="chapnum">43</span>It
      happened that two legions met in the open fields between the high road and
      the Po. These were: for Vitellius the Twenty-first, commonly called <a
      name="1fnm303"></a>Rapax,<a href="#1fn303" class="fnnum">303</a> a
      regiment of old renown; and for Otho the First <a name="1fnm304"></a>Adiutrix,<a
      href="#1fn304" class="fnnum">304</a> which had never been in battle
      before, but was full of spirit and eager to win its first laurels. Their
      charge overthrew the front ranks of the Twenty-first, and they carried off
      its eagle. Fired with indignation, the Twenty-first rallied and charged
      the front of the enemy, killing the commanding officer, Orfidius Benignus,
      and capturing many of their colours.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other flank the <a name="1fnm305"></a>Fifth<a href="#1fn305"
      class="fnnum">305</a> drove the <a name="1fnm306"></a>Thirteenth<a
      href="#1fn306" class="fnnum">306</a> <a name="1page152"></a><span
      class="pagenum">152</span>off the field. The <a name="1fnm307"></a>Fourteenth<a
      href="#1fn307" class="fnnum">307</a> were surrounded by the numbers that
      attacked them. Otho's generals had long ago fled. Caecina and Valens began
      to bring up the reserves to the support of their men, and, as a fresh
      reinforcement, there arrived Varus <a name="1fnm308"></a>Alfenus<a
      href="#1fn308" class="fnnum">308</a> with his Batavians. They had routed
      the <a name="1fnm309"></a>gladiators<a href="#1fn309" class="fnnum">309</a>
      by confronting them and cutting them to pieces in the river before their
      transports could land, and flushed by their victory came charging in upon
      the flank of the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>

      centre broken, the Othonians fled in disorder, making for Bedriacum. The
      distance was immense;<a name="1fnm310"></a><a href="#1fn310" class="fnnum">310</a>
      the road encumbered with heaps of dead. This made the slaughter all the
      greater, for in civil war captives cannot be turned to <a name="1fnm311"></a>profit.<a
      href="#1fn311" class="fnnum">311</a> Suetonius Paulinus and Licinius
      Proculus avoided the camp at Bedriacum by diverse routes. Vedius Aquila,
      who commanded the Thirteenth legion, was so paralysed by fear that he
      allowed himself to fall into the hands of the indignant troops. It was
      still broad daylight when he entered <a name="1page153"></a><span
      class="pagenum">153</span>the camp. Immediately a crowd of mutinous
      fugitives came clamouring round him. They spared neither abuse nor
      violence, assailing him as a deserter and a traitor. They could bring no
      special charge against him, but the mob always lay their own disgrace on
      some one else. Night came to the aid of Titianus and Celsus, for Annius
      <a name="1fnm312"></a>Gallus<a href="#1fn312" class="fnnum">312</a> had
      already placed sentinels on guard and got the men under control. Using
      remonstrances, prayers, and commands, he had induced them not to add to
      the disaster of their defeat by murdering their own friends. Whether the
      war was over, or whether they wanted to fight again, in defeat, he told
      them, union was the one thing that could help them. All the other <a
      name="1fnm313"></a>troops<a href="#1fn313" class="fnnum">313</a> were
      crushed by the blow. The Guards complained that they had been beaten, not
      by the enemy's valour, but by sheer treachery. 'Why,' they said, 'even the
      Vitellians have won no bloodless victory. We beat their cavalry and
      captured a standard from one of their legions. We still have Otho left and
      all the troops with him on the other side of the Po. The Moesian <a
      name="1fnm314"></a>legions<a href="#1fn314" class="fnnum">314</a> are on
      their way. There is a large force left at Bedriacum. These, at any rate,
      have not been defeated yet. Better fall, if need be, on the field.' Now
      exasperated, now depressed by these reflections, they were in a state of
      blank despair, which more often aroused their anger than their fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap45" id="IIchap45"></a><span class="chapnum">45</span>The
      Vitellian army halted at the fifth mile-stone on <a name="1page154"></a><span
      class="pagenum">154</span>the road from Bedriacum. Their generals would
      not venture to storm the camp that same day, and hoped the enemy would
      consent to surrender. However, although they were in fighting trim, and
      had no implements for digging trenches, they felt safe with their arms and
      the pride of victory. On the next day there was no doubt about the wishes
      of the Othonians. Even those who showed most spirit had now changed their
      minds. So they sent a deputation. The Vitellian generals had no hesitation
      in granting terms. However, they detained the deputation for a short time,
      which caused some qualms to those who did not know whether it had been
      successful. At length the envoys returned, and the gates of the camp were
      opened. Then both victors and vanquished burst into tears, and with a sort
      of sorrowful satisfaction cursed their fate of civil war. There in one
      tent were men of both armies, nursing a wounded brother or some other
      relative. Their hopes of recompense were doubtful: all that was certain
      was bereavement and grief, for no one was so fortunate as to mourn no
      loss. They searched for the body of the fallen officer, Orfidius, and
      burnt it with due solemnity. Of the other dead, some were buried by their
      relatives, the rest were left lying on the ground.

      <a name="IIchap46" id="IIchap46"></a><span class="chapnum">46</span>Otho<a
      name="1fnm315"></a><a href="#1fn315" class="fnnum">315</a> was awaiting
      news of the battle with perfect confidence and firm resolve. First came a
      disquieting rumour. Soon fugitives from the field revealed the ruin of his
      cause. But the soldiers in their zeal did <a name="1page155"></a><span
      class="pagenum">155</span>not wait to hear their emperor speak. 'Keep a
      good heart,' they said, 'you still have fresh forces left, and, as for us,
      we are ready to risk everything and suffer everything.' Nor was this
      flattery. In a wild passion of enthusiasm they urged him to march to the
      field and restore the fortunes of his party. Those who were near him
      clasped his knees, while those who stood further off stretched out their
      arms to <a name="1fnm316"></a>him.<a href="#1fn316" class="fnnum">316</a>
      The most eager of all was Plotius Firmus, the Prefect of the Guard, who
      besought Otho again and again not to desert a supremely faithful army, men
      who had done him such great service. He told him that it showed more
      courage to bear misfortune than to give in: that men of vigour and courage
      cling to their hopes even in the face of disaster: it is only cowards who
      let their terror hurry them into despair. Amid all these appeals the
      soldiers now cheered, now groaned, according as Otho's expression showed
      signs of yielding or seemed to harden. Nor were these feelings confined to
      Otho's own Guards. The first arrivals from Moesia assured him that the
      spirit of the advancing force was just as firm, and that they had already
      entered <a name="1fnm317"></a>Aquileia.<a href="#1fn317" class="fnnum">317</a>
      There is no room for doubt that it was still possible to revive this cruel
      and pitiable war, so full of uncertainty to both <a name="1fnm318"></a>parties.<a

      himself disliked the policy of fighting. 'Am I,' he said, 'to expose all
      your splendid courage and devotion to further risks? That would be too
      great a price to pay for my life. Your high hopes of succeeding, if I were
      minded to live, will only swell the glory of my death. We have learnt to
      know each other, Fortune and I. Do not reckon the length of my reign.
      Self-control is all the harder when a man knows that his fortune cannot
      last. It was Vitellius who began the civil war. He originated the policy
      of fighting for the throne. But one battle is enough. This is the
      precedent that I will set. Let posterity judge me by it. I do not grudge
      Vitellius his brother, or wife, or children. I want neither revenge nor
      consolation. Others may have held the sceptre longer, but no one can ever
      have laid it down so bravely. Am I the man to allow the flower of Rome in
      all these famous armies to be mown down once again and lost to the
      country? Let me take with me the consciousness that you would have died
      for me. But you must stay and live. No more delay. I must no longer
      interfere with your chance of pardon, nor you with my resolve. It is a
      sort of cowardice to go on talking about the end. Here is your best proof
      of my determination: I complain of no one. To blame gods or men is his
      alone who fain would keep his life.'

      some such speech as this he urged them courteously to hurry away and not
      to exasperate the victor by their hesitation. To each man's age and
      position he paid due regard, using his authority with the young and
      persuasion with his elders, while his quiet looks and firm speech helped
      to control their ill-timed tears. He gave orders for boats and carriages
      to be provided for their departure. All petitions and letters containing
      any compliments to himself, or marked insults to Vitellius, he destroyed,
      and distributed his money carefully, not like a man at the point of death.
      He then actually tried to comfort the sorrowful fears of his nephew,
      Salvius Cocceianus,<a name="1fnm319"></a><a href="#1fn319" class="fnnum">319</a>
      by praising his attachment and chiding his alarm. 'Do you imagine,' he
      said, 'that Vitellius will be so hard-hearted as not to show me some
      gratitude for saving his whole household? By promptly putting an end to
      myself, I deserve to earn some mercy for my family. For it is not in blank
      despair, but with my army clamouring for battle, that I determine to save
      my country from the last calamities. I have won enough fame for myself and
      ennoblement for my posterity; for, after the line of the Julians,
      Claudians, Servians,<a name="1fnm320"></a><a href="#1fn320" class="fnnum">320</a>
      I have been the first to bring the principate into a new family. So rouse
      yourself and go on with your life. Never forget that Otho was your uncle,
      yet keep your remembrance within bounds.'

      this he made them all retire and rested for a while. But his last
      reflections were interrupted by a sudden disturbance and the news of a
      mutinous outbreak among the troops. They were threatening to kill all
      those who were leaving, and turned with especial violence against <a
      name="1fnm321"></a>Verginius,<a href="#1fn321" class="fnnum">321</a> whose
      house was in a state of siege. Otho rebuked the ringleaders and returned,
      consenting to receive the adieux of those who were going, until it was
      time for them to depart in safety. As the day deepened into evening he
      quenched his thirst with a drink of iced water. Two daggers were brought
      to him and, after trying them both, he put one under his pillow. Being
      assured on inquiry that his friends had started, he spent a peaceful
      night, not, it is said, without sleep. At break of <a name="1fnm322"></a>day<a
      href="#1fn322" class="fnnum">322</a> he fell upon his dagger. Hearing his
      dying groan, his slaves and freedmen entered with Plotius Firmus, the
      Prefect of the Guards, and found a single wound in his breast. The funeral
      was hurried forward out of respect for his own earnest entreaties, for he
      had been afraid his head might be cut off and subjected to outrage. The
      Guard carried the body, sounding his praises with tears in their eyes, and
      covering his hands and wounded breast with kisses. Some of the soldiers
      killed themselves beside the pyre, not because they had harmed Vitellius
      or feared reprisals, but from love of their emperor, and to follow his
      noble example. Similar suicides became common afterwards at Bedriacum <a
      name="1page159"></a><span class="pagenum">159</span>and Placentia, and in
      other encampments.<a name="1fnm323"></a><a href="#1fn323" class="fnnum">323</a>
      An inconspicuous tomb was built for Otho, as being less likely to be
      disturbed: and thus he ended his life in his thirty-seventh year.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap50" id="IIchap50"></a><span class="chapnum">50</span>Otho
      came originally from the borough of <a name="1fnm324"></a>Ferentium.<a
      href="#1fn324" class="fnnum">324</a> His father had been consul and his
      grandfather praetor. His mother's family was inferior, but not without
      <a name="1fnm325"></a>distinction.<a href="#1fn325" class="fnnum">325</a>
      His boyhood and youth were such as we have seen. By his two great <a
      name="1fnm326"></a>acts,<a href="#1fn326" class="fnnum">326</a> one most
      criminal and the other heroic, he earned in equal measure the praise and
      the reprobation of posterity. It would certainly be beneath the dignity of
      my task to collect fabulous rumours for the amusement of my readers, but
      there are certain popular traditions which I cannot venture to contradict.
      On the day of the battle of Bedriacum, according to the account of the
      local peasants, a strange bird appeared in a much-frequented grove near
      Regium <a name="1fnm327"></a>Lepidum.<a href="#1fn327" class="fnnum">327</a>
      There it sat, unterrified and unmoved, either by the crowds of people or
      by the birds which fluttered round it, until the moment at which Otho
      killed himself. Then it vanished. A calculation of the time showed that
      the prodigy's appearance and disappearance coincided with the beginning of
      the <a name="1fnm328"></a>battle<a href="#1fn328" class="fnnum">328</a>
      and Otho's death.

      <a name="IIchap51" id="IIchap51"></a><span class="chapnum">51</span>At his
      funeral the rage and grief of the soldiers broke out into another mutiny.
      This time there was no one to control them. They turned to Verginius and
      begged him with threats now to accept the principate, now to head a
      deputation to Caecina and Valens. However, Verginius escaped them,
      slipping out by the back door of his house just as they broke in at the
      front. Rubrius Gallus carried a petition from the Guards at Brixellum, and
      obtained immediate pardon. Simultaneously Flavius Sabinus surrendered to
      the victor the troops under his <a name="1fnm329"></a>command.<a

          </span>About seven miles below Cremona. The Medicean MS. has Adua, but
          as the mouth of the Adua is seven miles west of Cremona and Bedriacum
          twenty-two miles east of Cremona, the figures given do not suit. For
          Tacitus says that they marched first four miles and then sixteen. Mr.
          Henderson proposes to solve the difficulty by reading <i>quartum
          decimum</i> for <i>quartum</i> in chap. <a href="#IIchap39">39</a>.
          But his reasons are purely <i>a priori</i>. If the confluence was that
          of the <i>Arda</i> with the Po, Tacitus' <i>quartum</i> is still
          unsatisfactory, but the distances given in Plutarch's Life of Otho
          would suit the facts. He makes the first march a little over six
          miles. From the camp then pitched to the mouth of the Arda would be by
          road about sixteen miles. Thus Tacitus' first figure may be a slight
          underestimate and his second figure correct. The second day's march,
          according to Plutarch, was rather more than twelve miles, so we may
          suppose that the armies met about four miles short of the confluence,
          which was the Othonians' objective. This suits Paulinus' suggestion a
          few lines lower that the Vitellians need only march four miles to
          catch them in marching column. The whole question is fully discussed
          by Mr. Henderson (op. cit.) and by Mr. E.G. Hardy in the <i>Journal of
          Philology</i>, vol. xxxi, no. 61.

          his main force had capitulated at Bedriacum, Otho had no sufficient

          Danube army at Aquileia.

    </h3>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap52" id="IIchap52"></a><span class="chapnum">52</span>Now
      that the war was everywhere ended, a large number of senators, who had
      quitted Rome with Otho and been left behind at Mutina,<a name="1fnm330"></a><a
      href="#1fn330" class="fnnum">330</a> found themselves in a critical
      position. When the news of the defeat reached Mutina, the soldiers paid no
      heed to what they took for a baseless rumour, and, believing the senators
      to be hostile to Otho, they treasured up their conversation and put the
      worst interpretation on their looks and behaviour. In time they broke into
      abusive reproaches, seeking a pretext for starting a general massacre,
      while the senators suffered at the same time from another source of alarm,
      for they were afraid of seeming to be slow in welcoming the victory of the
      now predominant Vitellian party. Terrified at their double danger, they
      held a meeting. For no one <a name="1page161"></a><span class="pagenum">161</span>dared
      to form any policy for himself; each felt safer in sharing his guilt with
      others. The town-council of Mutina, too, kept adding to their anxiety by
      offering them arms and money, styling them with ill-timed respect
      'Conscript Fathers'. <a name="IIchap53" id="IIchap53"></a><span
      class="chapnum">53</span>A remarkable quarrel arose at this meeting.
      Licinius Caecina attacked Eprius <a name="1fnm331"></a>Marcellus<a
      href="#1fn331" class="fnnum">331</a> for the ambiguity of his language.
      Not that the others disclosed their sentiments, but Caecina, who was still
      a nobody, recently raised to the senate, sought to distinguish himself by
      quarrelling with some one of importance, and selected Marcellus, because
      the memory of his career as an informer made him an object of loathing.
      They were parted by the prudent intervention of their betters, and all
      then retired to <a name="1fnm332"></a>Bononia,<a href="#1fn332"
      class="fnnum">332</a> intending to continue the discussion there, and
      hoping for more news in the meantime. At Bononia they dispatched men along
      the roads in every direction to question all new-comers. From one of
      Otho's freedmen they inquired why he had come away, and were told he was
      carrying his master's last instructions: the man said that when he had
      left, Otho was still indeed alive, but had renounced the pleasures of life
      and was devoting all his thoughts to posterity. This filled them with
      admiration. They felt ashamed to ask any more questions&mdash;and declared
      unanimously for Vitellius.

    <p>
      <a name="IIchap54" id="IIchap54"></a><span class="chapnum">54</span>Vitellius'
      brother Lucius was present at their discussion, and now displayed his
      willingness to receive their flattery, but one of Nero's freedmen, called
      Coenus, suddenly startled them all by inventing the atrocious falsehood
      that the Fourteenth legion had joined forces with the troops at Brixellum,
      and that their sudden arrival had turned the fortune of the day: the
      victorious army had been cut to pieces. He hoped by inventing this good
      news to regain some authority for Otho's <a name="1fnm333"></a>passports,<a
      href="#1fn333" class="fnnum">333</a> which were beginning to be
      disregarded. He did, indeed, thus insure for himself a quick journey to
      Rome, but was executed by order of Vitellius a few days later. However,
      the senate's danger was augmented because the soldiers believed the news.
      Their fears were the more acute, because it looked as if their departure
      from Mutina was an official move of the Council of State, which thus
      seemed to have deserted the party. So they refrained from holding any more
      meetings, and each shifted for himself, until a letter arrived from Fabius
      Valens which quieted their fears. Besides, the news of Otho's death
      travelled all the more quickly because it excited admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap55" id="IIchap55"></a><span class="chapnum">55</span>At
      Rome, however, there was no sign of panic. The festival of <a
      name="1fnm334"></a>Ceres<a href="#1fn334" class="fnnum">334</a> was
      celebrated by the usual crowds. When it was reported in the theatre on
      reliable authority that Otho had renounced his <a name="1fnm335"></a>claim,<a
      href="#1fn335" class="fnnum">335</a> and <a name="1page163"></a><span
      class="pagenum">163</span>that Flavius <a name="1fnm336"></a>Sabinus,<a
      href="#1fn336" class="fnnum">336</a> the City Prefect, had made all the
      troops in Rome swear allegiance to Vitellius, the audience cheered
      Vitellius. The populace decked all the busts of Galba with laurel-leaves
      and flowers, and carried them round from temple to temple. The garlands
      were eventually piled up into a sort of tomb near Lake <a name="1fnm337"></a>Curtius,<a
      href="#1fn337" class="fnnum">337</a> on the spot which Galba had stained
      with his life-blood. In the senate the distinctions devised during the
      long reigns of other emperors were all conferred on Vitellius at <a
      name="1fnm338"></a>once.<a href="#1fn338" class="fnnum">338</a> To these
      was added a vote of thanks and congratulation to the German army, and a
      deputation was dispatched to express the senate's satisfaction. Letters
      were read which Fabius Valens had addressed to the consuls in very
      moderate terms. But Caecina's moderation was still more gratifying: he had
      not written at <a name="1fnm339"></a>all.<a href="#1fn339" class="fnnum">339</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap56" id="IIchap56"></a><span class="chapnum">56</span>However,
      Italy found peace a more ghastly burden than the war. Vitellius' soldiers
      scattered through all the boroughs and colonial towns, indulging in
      plunder, violence, and rape. Impelled by their greed or the promise of
      payment, they cared nothing for right and wrong: kept their hands off
      nothing sacred or profane. Even civilians put on uniform and seized the
      opportunity to murder their enemies. The soldiers themselves, <a
      name="1page164"></a><span class="pagenum">164</span>knowing the
      countryside well, marked down the richest fields and wealthiest houses for
      plunder, determined to murder any one who offered resistance. Their
      generals were too much in their debt to venture any opposition. Of the two
      Caecina showed less greed and more ambition. Valens had earned a bad name
      by his own ill-gotten gains, and was therefore bound to shut his eyes to
      others' <a name="1fnm340"></a>shortcomings.<a href="#1fn340" class="fnnum">340</a>
      The resources of Italy had long been exhausted; all these thousands of
      infantry and cavalry, all this violence and damage and outrage was almost
      more than the country could bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap57" id="IIchap57"></a><span class="chapnum">57</span>Meanwhile
      Vitellius knew nothing of his victory. With the remainder of his German
      army he continued to advance as though the war had just begun. A few of
      the veterans were left in winter quarters, and troops were hurriedly
      enlisted in the Gallic provinces, to fill up the vacancies in what were
      now mere skeleton legions.<a name="1fnm341"></a><a href="#1fn341"
      class="fnnum">341</a> Leaving Hordeonius Flaccus to guard the line of the
      Rhine, Vitellius advanced with a picked detachment from the army in
      Britain, eight thousand strong. After a few days' march he received news
      of the victory of Bedriacum and the collapse of the war on the death of
      Otho. He summoned a meeting and heaped praise on the courage of the
      troops. When the <a name="1page165"></a><span class="pagenum">165</span>army
      demanded that he should confer equestrian rank on his freedman Asiaticus,
      he checked their shameful flattery. Then with characteristic instability
      he granted at a private banquet what he had refused in public. This
      Asiaticus, who was thus decorated with the gold ring, was an infamous
      menial who rose by his <a name="1fnm342"></a>vices.<a href="#1fn342"
      class="fnnum">342</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap58" id="IIchap58"></a><span class="chapnum">58</span>During
      these same days news arrived that Albinus, the Governor of Mauretania, had
      been murdered, and both <a name="1fnm343"></a>provinces<a href="#1fn343"
      class="fnnum">343</a> had declared for Vitellius. Appointed by Nero to the
      province of Mauretania Caesariensis, Lucceius Albinus had further received
      from Galba the governorship of Tingitana, and thus commanded a very
      considerable force, consisting of nineteen cohorts of infantry, five
      regiments of horse, and an immense horde of Moors, well trained for war by
      their practice in plunder. After Galba's murder he inclined to Otho's side
      and, not contented with the province of Africa, began to threaten Spain on
      the other side of the narrow strait. Cluvius Rufus,<a name="1fnm344"></a><a
      href="#1fn344" class="fnnum">344</a> alarmed at this, moved the Tenth <a
      name="1fnm345"></a>legion<a href="#1fn345" class="fnnum">345</a> down to
      the coast as though for transport. He also sent some centurions ahead to
      gain the sympathies of the Moors for Vitellius. The great reputation of
      the German army throughout the provinces facilitated this task, and they
      also spread a <a name="1page166"></a><span class="pagenum">166</span>rumour
      that Albinus was not contented with the title of 'Governor', and wanted to
      adopt a regal style under the name of Juba. So the sympathies of the army
      shifted. <a name="IIchap59" id="IIchap59"></a><span class="chapnum">59</span>Asinius
      Pollio, who commanded the local cavalry, one of Albinus' most loyal
      friends, was assassinated. The same fate befell Festus and Scipio, who
      were in command of the <a name="1fnm346"></a>infantry.<a href="#1fn346"
      class="fnnum">346</a> Albinus himself embarked from Tingitana for
      Caesariensis, and was murdered as he landed. His wife confronted the
      assassins and was murdered too. How all this happened Vitellius never
      inquired. He passed by events of the highest importance after a few
      moments' attention, being quite unable to cope with serious matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching the <a name="1fnm347"></a>Arar,<a href="#1fn347" class="fnnum">347</a>
      Vitellius ordered his army to march overland while he sailed down the
      river. Travelling with no imperial state, he had nothing but his original
      <a name="1fnm348"></a>poverty<a href="#1fn348" class="fnnum">348</a> to
      make him conspicuous, until Junius Blaesus, Governor of the Lyons division
      of Gaul, a member of an eminent family, whose liberality matched his
      wealth, provided the emperor <a name="1page167"></a><span class="pagenum">167</span>with
      a staff and escorted him in person with great courtesy, an attention which
      proved most unwelcome to Vitellius, although he concealed his annoyance
      under the grossest flattery. At Lugdunum he found the generals of both
      parties awaiting him. Valens and Caecina were openly commended at a public
      meeting, and given places on either side of the emperor's throne. He then
      sent the whole army to fetch his infant <a name="1fnm349"></a>son,<a
      href="#1fn349" class="fnnum">349</a> and when they brought him wearing a
      general's uniform, Vitellius took him up in his arms and named him <a
      name="1fnm350"></a>Germanicus,<a href="#1fn350" class="fnnum">350</a> at
      the same time decorating him with all the insignia of his imperial
      position. The exaggerated honours of these days proved the child's only
      consolation for the evil times which <a name="1fnm351"></a>followed.<a
      href="#1fn351" class="fnnum">351</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap60" id="IIchap60"></a><span class="chapnum">60</span>The
      most energetic of Otho's centurions were now executed, which did more than
      anything else to alienate the armies of Illyricum. The other legions also
      caught the infection, and their dislike of the German troops made them
      harbour thoughts of war. Suetonius Paulinus and Licinius Proculus were
      kept in <a name="1fnm352"></a>mourning<a href="#1fn352" class="fnnum">352</a>
      and suspense, disheartened by delay. When at last their case was heard,
      their pleas savoured more of necessity than honour. They positively
      claimed credit for treachery, alleging that the long march before the
      battle, the fatigue of their troops, and the confusion <a name="1page168"></a><span
      class="pagenum">168</span>created by the wagons in their lines were all
      due not to chance, but to their own treachery. Vitellius believed their
      protestations of treason, and acquitted them of all suspicion of loyalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otho's brother, Salvius Titianus, was in no danger. His affection for his
      brother and his personal inefficiency excused him. Marius Celsus was
      allowed to hold his <a name="1fnm353"></a>consulship.<a href="#1fn353"
      class="fnnum">353</a> But rumour gave rise to a belief which led to an
      attack being made in the senate against Caecilius Simplex, who was charged
      with trying to purchase the consulship and to secure Celsus' destruction.
      Vitellius, however, refused this, and afterwards allowed Simplex to hold
      the consulship without detriment to his conscience or his purse. Trachalus
      was protected against his accusers by Galeria, Vitellius' <a name="1fnm354"></a>wife.<a
      href="#1fn354" class="fnnum">354</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap61" id="IIchap61"></a><span class="chapnum">61</span>With
      so many of the great in danger of their lives, an obscure creature called
      Mariccus, of the tribe of the <a name="1fnm355"></a>Boii<a href="#1fn355"
      class="fnnum">355</a>&mdash;it is a sordid <a name="1fnm356"></a>incident<a
      href="#1fn356" class="fnnum">356</a>&mdash;endeavoured to thrust himself
      into greatness and to challenge the armies of Rome, pretending to be a
      minister of Heaven. This divine champion of the Gauls, as he had entitled
      himself, had already gathered a force of eight thousand men, and began
      making <a name="1fnm357"></a>overtures<a href="#1fn357" class="fnnum">357</a>
      to the neighbouring <a name="1page169"></a><span class="pagenum">169</span>Aeduan
      villages. But the chief community of the Aedui wisely sent out a picked
      force, with some Vitellian troops in support, and scattered the mob of
      fanatics. Mariccus was captured in the engagement, and later thrown to
      wild <a name="1fnm358"></a>beasts.<a href="#1fn358" class="fnnum">358</a>
      As they refused to devour him, the common people stupidly believed him
      invulnerable, until he was executed in the presence of Vitellius.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap62" id="IIchap62"></a><span class="chapnum">62</span>No
      further measures were taken against the life or property of the <a
      name="1fnm359"></a>rebels.<a href="#1fn359" class="fnnum">359</a> The
      estates of those who had fallen fighting for Otho were allowed to devolve
      by will or else by the law of intestate succession. Indeed, if Vitellius
      had set limits to his luxury, there was no need to fear his greed for
      money. It was his foul and insatiable gluttony. Rome and Italy were
      scoured for dainties to tickle his palate: from shore to shore the high
      roads rang with the traffic. The leading provincials were ruined by having
      to provide for his table. The very towns were impoverished. Meanwhile the
      soldiers were acquiring luxurious habits, learning to despise their
      general, and gradually losing their former efficiency and courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vitellius sent a manifesto on to Rome in which he declined the title of
      Caesar, and postponed calling himself Augustus without giving up any
      portion of <a name="1page170"></a><span class="pagenum">170</span>his
      power. All <a name="1fnm360"></a>astrologers<a href="#1fn360" class="fnnum">360</a>
      were exiled from Italy, and rigorous provision was made to restrain Roman
      knights from the disgrace of appearing at the games in the <a
      name="1fnm361"></a>arena.<a href="#1fn361" class="fnnum">361</a> Former
      emperors had paid, or more often compelled them to do this, and many of
      the provincial towns vied together in hiring the most profligate young
      aristocrats.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap63" id="IIchap63"></a><span class="chapnum">63</span>The
      arrival of his brother and the growing influence of his tutors in tyranny
      made Vitellius daily more haughty and cruel. He gave orders for the
      execution of Dolabella, whom Otho, as we have seen,<a name="1fnm362"></a><a
      href="#1fn362" class="fnnum">362</a> had relegated to the colonial town of
      Aquinum. On hearing of Otho's death, he had ventured back to Rome.
      Whereupon an ex-praetor, named Plancius Varus, one of Dolabella's closest
      friends, laid information before the city prefect, Flavius Sabinus,
      maintaining that he had broken from custody to put himself at the head of
      the defeated party. He added that Dolabella had tried to tamper with the
      cohort stationed at <a name="1fnm363"></a>Ostia.<a href="#1fn363"
      class="fnnum">363</a> Having no proof of these very serious charges, he
      repented and begged for his friend's forgiveness. But it was too late. The
      crime was committed. While Flavius Sabinus was hesitating what to do in
      such a serious matter, Lucius Vitellius' wife, <a name="1page171"></a><span
      class="pagenum">171</span>Triaria, whose cruelty was altogether unwomanly,
      terrified him by suggesting that he was trying to get a reputation for
      mercy at the expense of his emperor's safety. Sabinus was naturally of a
      kindly disposition, but easily changed under the influence of fear. Though
      it was not he who was in danger, he was full of alarms, and hastened
      Dolabella's impending ruin for fear of being supposed to have helped him.
      <a name="IIchap64" id="IIchap64"></a><span class="chapnum">64</span>Vitellius,
      accordingly, from motives both of suspicion and of hatred (Dolabella had
      married his divorced wife Petronia), summoned Dolabella by letter to avoid
      the crowded thoroughfare of the Flaminian road and to turn off to
      Interamnium,<a name="1fnm364"></a><a href="#1fn364" class="fnnum">364</a>
      where he gave orders for his murder. The assassin found the journey
      tedious; discovered his victim sleeping on the floor at a wayside inn, and
      cut his throat. This gave the new government a very bad name. People took
      it as a specimen of what to expect. Triaria's shameless behaviour was
      further emphasized by the exemplary behaviour of her relative Galeria, the
      emperor's wife, who kept clear of these dreadful doings. Equally admirable
      was the character of his mother, Sextilia, a woman of the old school. It
      was even on record that when her son's first letters were read to her, she
      said, 'It was no <a name="1fnm365"></a>Germanicus,<a href="#1fn365"
      class="fnnum">365</a> but a Vitellius that I brought into the world.' From
      that time neither the attractions of her high station nor the unanimous
      flattery of Rome could win her over to complacence. She only shared the
      sorrows of her house.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap65" id="IIchap65"></a><span class="chapnum">65</span>When
      Vitellius left Lugdunum, Cluvius <a name="1fnm366"></a>Rufus<a
      href="#1fn366" class="fnnum">366</a> <a name="1page172"></a><span
      class="pagenum">172</span>relinquished his Spanish province and followed
      him. He knew that serious charges had been made against him, and his
      smiling congratulations hid an anxious heart. A freedman of the imperial
      court,<a name="1fnm367"></a><a href="#1fn367" class="fnnum">367</a>
      Hilarus by name, had given evidence against him, alleging that, when
      Cluvius heard of the rival claims of Otho and Vitellius, he had
      endeavoured to set up an independent authority of his own in Spain, and to
      this end had issued passports with no emperor's name at the <a
      name="1fnm368"></a>head.<a href="#1fn368" class="fnnum">368</a> Certain
      phrases in his speeches were also construed as damaging to Vitellius and
      as a bid for his own popularity. However, Cluvius' influence carried the
      day, and Vitellius even had his own freedman punished. Cluvius was given a
      place at court, while still retaining Spain, of which he was absentee
      governor, following the precedent of Lucius Arruntius. In his case,
      however, Tiberius' motive had been suspicion, whereas Vitellius detained
      Cluvius without any such <a name="1fnm369"></a>qualms.<a href="#1fn369"
      class="fnnum">369</a> Trebellius <a name="1fnm370"></a>Maximus<a
      href="#1fn370" class="fnnum">370</a> was not allowed the same privilege.
      He had fled from Britain to escape the fury of his troops. Vettius
      Bolanus, who was then about the court, was sent out to take his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1page173"></a><span class="pagenum">173</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap66" id="IIchap66"></a><span class="chapnum">66</span>The
      soldiers of the defeated legions still gave Vitellius a good deal of
      anxiety. Their spirit was by no means broken. They distributed themselves
      all over Italy, mingling with the victors and talking treason. The most
      uncompromising of all were the Fourteenth, who refused to acknowledge
      their defeat. At Bedriacum, they argued, it was only a detachment that had
      been beaten, the main strength of the legion was not <a name="1fnm371"></a>present.<a
      href="#1fn371" class="fnnum">371</a> It was decided to send them back to
      Britain, whence Nero had summoned them, and meanwhile they were to share
      their quarters with the Batavian irregulars, because of the long-standing
      feud between <a name="1fnm372"></a>them.<a href="#1fn372" class="fnnum">372</a>
      Quartered as they were under arms, their mutual hatred soon broke out into
      disorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      At <a name="1fnm373"></a>Turin<a href="#1fn373" class="fnnum">373</a> one
      of the Batavians was cursing a workman for having cheated him, when a
      legionary, who lodged with the workman, took his part. Each quickly
      gathered his fellow soldiers round him, and from abuse they came to
      bloodshed. Indeed, a fierce battle would have broken out, unless two
      regiments of Guards had sided with the Fourteenth, thus giving them
      confidence and frightening the Batavians. Vitellius gave orders that the
      Batavians should be drafted into his army, while the legion was to be
      marched over the Graian <a name="1fnm374"></a>Alps<a href="#1fn374"
      class="fnnum">374</a> by a d&eacute;tour which would avoid <a
      name="1fnm375"></a>Vienne.<a href="#1fn375" class="fnnum">375</a> Its
      inhabitants were another <a name="1page174"></a><span class="pagenum">174</span>cause
      for <a name="1fnm376"></a>alarm.<a href="#1fn376" class="fnnum">376</a> On
      the night on which the legion started they left fires burning all over
      Turin, and part of the town was burnt down. This disaster, like so many
      others in the civil war, has been obliterated by the greater calamities
      which befell other cities. No sooner were the Fourteenth across the Alps
      than the most mutinous spirits started off to march for Vienne, but they
      were stopped by the unanimous interference of the better men, and the
      legion was shipped across to Britain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap67" id="IIchap67"></a><span class="chapnum">67</span>Vitellius'
      next cause of anxiety was the Guards. At first they were quartered apart,
      and then, appeased by an honourable discharge,<a name="1fnm377"></a><a
      href="#1fn377" class="fnnum">377</a> they gave up their arms to their
      officers. But when the news went round of the war with Vespasian, they
      enlisted again and formed the main strength of the Flavian party.
    </p>
    <p>
      The First legion of marines was sent to Spain to cultivate docility in
      peace and quiet. The Eleventh and the Seventh were sent back to their
      winter <a name="1fnm378"></a>quarters.<a href="#1fn378" class="fnnum">378</a>
      The Thirteenth were set to work to build amphitheatres. For Caecina at
      Cremona and Valens at Bononia were each preparing to give a gladiatorial
      show. Vitellius never let his anxieties interfere with his pleasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap68" id="IIchap68"></a><span class="chapnum">68</span>The
      losing party being thus dispersed by peaceful means, disorder broke out in
      the victorious camp. <a name="1page175"></a><span class="pagenum">175</span>It
      originated in sport, but the number of deaths increased the feeling
      against Vitellius. He had invited Verginius to dine with him at Ticinum,
      and they had just sat down to table. The conduct of officers is always
      determined by the behaviour of their generals; it depends on that whether
      they adopt the simple life or indulge their taste for riotous living;<a
      name="1fnm379"></a><a href="#1fn379" class="fnnum">379</a> this again
      determines whether the troops are smart or disorderly. In Vitellius' army
      disorder and drunkenness were universal: it was more like a midnight <a
      name="1fnm380"></a>orgy<a href="#1fn380" class="fnnum">380</a> than a
      properly disciplined camp. So it happened that two of the soldiers, one
      belonging to the Fifth legion, the other to the Gallic auxiliaries, in a
      drunken frolic challenged each other to wrestle. The legionary fell; and
      when the Gaul began to exult over him, the soldiers who had gathered round
      took sides, and the legionaries, breaking out against the auxiliaries with
      murderous intent, actually cut to pieces a couple of cohorts. This
      commotion was only cured by another. A cloud of dust and the glitter of
      arms appeared on the horizon. Suddenly a cry arose that the Fourteenth had
      turned back and were marching on them. However, it was their own
      rear-guard bringing up the stragglers. This discovery quieted their alarm.
      Meanwhile, coming across one of Verginius' slaves, they <a name="1page176"></a><span
      class="pagenum">176</span>charged him with intending to assassinate
      Vitellius, and rushed off to the banquet clamouring for Verginius' head.
      No one really doubted his innocence, not even Vitellius, who always
      quailed at a breath of suspicion. Yet, though it was the death of an
      ex-consul, their own former general, which they demanded, it was with
      difficulty that they were quieted. No one was a target for these outbreaks
      so often as Verginius. He still retained the admiration and esteem of the
      men, but they hated him for disdaining their <a name="1fnm381"></a>offer.<a
      href="#1fn381" class="fnnum">381</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap69" id="IIchap69"></a><span class="chapnum">69</span>On the
      next day Vitellius granted an audience to the deputation of the senate,
      which he had told to await him at Ticinum. He then entered the camp and
      spontaneously complimented the troops on their devotion to <a
      name="1fnm382"></a>him.<a href="#1fn382" class="fnnum">382</a> This made
      the auxiliaries grumble at the growing licence and impunity allowed to the
      legions. So the Batavians, for fear of some desperate outbreak, were sent
      back to Germany, where Fortune was contriving for us a war that was at
      once both civil and <a name="1fnm383"></a>foreign.<a href="#1fn383"
      class="fnnum">383</a> The Gallic auxiliaries were also sent home. Their
      numbers were very large, and had been used at the first outbreak of the
      rebellion for an empty parade of force. Indeed, the imperial finances were
      already embarrassed by the distribution of largess, to meet the expenses
      of which Vitellius gave orders for <a name="1page177"></a><span
      class="pagenum">177</span>depleting the strength of the legions and
      auxiliaries. Recruiting was forbidden, and discharges offered without
      restriction. This policy was disastrous for the country and unpopular
      among the soldiers, who found that their turn for work and danger came
      round all the more frequently, now that there were so few to share the
      duties. Besides, their efficiency was demoralized by luxury. Nothing was
      left of the old-fashioned discipline and the good rules of our ancestors,
      who preferred to base the security of Rome on character and not on money.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap70" id="IIchap70"></a><span class="chapnum">70</span>Leaving
      Ticinum Vitellius turned off to Cremona. There he witnessed Caecina's
      games and conceived a wish to stand upon the field of Bedriacum, and to
      see the traces of the recent victory with his own eyes. Within six weeks
      of the battle, it was a disgusting and horrible sight; mangled bodies,
      mutilated limbs, rotting carcasses of men and horses, the ground foul with
      clotted blood. Trees and crops all trampled down: the country-side a
      miserable waste. No less revolting to all human feeling was the stretch of
      road which the people of Cremona had strewn with laurel-leaves and roses,
      erecting altars and sacrificing victims as if in honour of an Oriental
      <a name="1fnm384"></a>despot.<a href="#1fn384" class="fnnum">384</a> The
      rejoicings of the moment soon turned to their <a name="1fnm385"></a>destruction.<a
      href="#1fn385" class="fnnum">385</a> Valens and Caecina were in attendance
      and showed Vitellius over the battle-field: this was where their <a
      name="1page178"></a><span class="pagenum">178</span>legions had charged:
      the cavalry took the field from here: this was where the auxiliaries were
      outflanked. The various <a name="1fnm386"></a>officers<a href="#1fn386"
      class="fnnum">386</a> each praised their own exploits, adding a few false
      or, at any rate, exaggerated touches. The common soldiers, too, turned
      gaily shouting from the high road to inspect the scene of their great
      struggle, gazing with wonder at the huge pile of arms and heaps of bodies.<a
      name="1fnm387"></a><a href="#1fn387" class="fnnum">387</a> There were a
      few who reflected with tears of pity on the shifting chances of life. But
      Vitellius never took his eyes off the field: never shuddered at the sight
      of all these thousands of Roman citizens lying <a name="1fnm388"></a>unburied.<a
      href="#1fn388" class="fnnum">388</a> On the contrary, he was very well
      pleased, and, unconscious of his own impending doom, he offered a
      sacrifice to the local deities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap71" id="IIchap71"></a><span class="chapnum">71</span>They
      next came to Bononia, where Fabius Valens gave a gladiatorial show, for
      which he had all the apparatus brought from Rome. The nearer they drew to
      the city, the greater became the disorder of the march, which was now
      joined by troops of actors, eunuchs and the like, all in the true spirit
      of Nero's court. For Vitellius always had a great personal admiration for
      Nero. He used to follow him about to hear him sing, not under compulsion&mdash;many
      a decent <a name="1page179"></a><span class="pagenum">179</span>man
      suffered that fate&mdash;but because he was the slave of his stomach, and
      had sold himself to luxury.

      To secure a few months of office for Valens and Caecina, the other consuls
      of the <a name="1fnm389"></a>year<a href="#1fn389" class="fnnum">389</a>
      had their terms shortened, while Martius Macer's claim was ignored as
      belonging to Otho's party. Valerius Marinus, who had been nominated by
      Galba, had his term postponed, not for any offence, but because he was a
      mild creature and too lazy to resent an injury. The name of Pedanius Costa
      was omitted altogether. Vitellius had never forgiven him for rising
      against Nero and instigating Verginius. However, he alleged other reasons.
      They all had to observe the servile custom of the time, and offer their
      thanks to Vitellius.

      for parts. The credulous mob and some of the soldiers, who were either
      victims of the imposture or anxious for a riot, eagerly flocked to join
      him. However, he was taken before Vitellius and his <a name="1page180"></a><span

          sense.

    <h3>
      <a name="The_Revolt_of_Vespasian" id="The_Revolt_of_Vespasian"></a>The
      Revolt of Vespasian
    </h3>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap73" id="IIchap73"></a><span class="chapnum">73</span>When
      once his couriers brought news from Syria and Judaea that the East had
      sworn allegiance to him, Vitellius' vanity and indolence reached a pitch
      which is almost incredible. For already, though the rumours were still
      vague and unreliable, Vespasian's name was in everybody's mouth, and the
      mention of him often roused Vitellius to alarm. Still, he and his army
      seemed to reck of no rival: they at once broke out into the unbridled
      cruelty, debauchery and oppression of some outlandish court.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap74" id="IIchap74"></a><span class="chapnum">74</span>Vespasian,
      on the other hand, was meditating war and reckoning all his forces both
      distant and near at hand. He had so much attached his troops to himself,
      that when he dictated to them the oath of allegiance and prayed that 'all
      might be well' with Vitellius, they listened in silence. Mucianus'
      feelings were not hostile to him, and were strongly sympathetic to Titus.
      Tiberius Alexander,<a name="1fnm392"></a><a href="#1fn392" class="fnnum">392</a>
      the Governor of Egypt, had made common cause with him. The Third <a
      name="1fnm393"></a>legion,<a href="#1fn393" class="fnnum">393</a> since it
      had crossed from Syria into Moesia, he could reckon as his own, and there
      was good hope that the other legions of Illyria would follow its <a
      name="1fnm394"></a>lead.<a href="#1fn394" class="fnnum">394</a> The whole
      <a name="1page181"></a><span class="pagenum">181</span>army, indeed, was
      incensed at the arrogance of Vitellius' soldiers: truculent in appearance
      and rough of tongue, they scoffed at all the other troops as their
      inferiors. But a war of such magnitude demands delay. High as were his
      hopes, Vespasian often calculated his risks. He realized that it would be
      a critical day for him when he committed his sixty summers and his two
      young sons to the chances of war. In his private ambitions a man may feel
      his way and take less or more from fortune's hands according as he feels
      inclined, but when one covets a throne there is no alternative between the
      zenith of success and headlong ruin. <a name="IIchap75" id="IIchap75"></a><span
      class="chapnum">75</span>Moreover, he always kept in view the strength of
      the German army, which, as a soldier, he realized. His own legions, he
      knew, had no experience of civil war, while Vitellius' troops were fresh
      from victory: and the defeated party were richer in grievances than in
      troops. Civil strife had undermined the loyalty of the troops: there was
      danger in each single man. What would be the good of all his horse and
      foot, if one or two traitors should seek the reward the enemy offered and
      assassinate him then and there? It was thus that <a name="1fnm395"></a>Scribonianus<a
      href="#1fn395" class="fnnum">395</a> had been killed in Claudius' reign,
      and his murderer, Volaginius, raised from a common soldier to the highest
      rank. It is easier to move men in the mass than to take precautions
      against them singly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap76" id="IIchap76"></a><span class="chapnum">76</span>These
      anxieties made Vespasian hesitate. Meanwhile the other generals and his
      friends continued to <a name="1page182"></a><span class="pagenum">182</span>encourage
      him. At last Mucianus after several private interviews went so far as to
      address him in public. 'Everybody,' he said, 'who plans some great exploit
      is bound to consider whether his enterprise serves both the public
      interest and his own reputation, and whether it is easily practicable or,
      at any rate, not impossible. He must also weigh the advice which he gets.
      Are those who offer it ready to run the risk themselves? And, if fortune
      favours, who gains the glory? I myself, Vespasian, call you to the throne.
      How much that may benefit the country and make you famous it lies with you&mdash;under
      Providence&mdash;to decide. You need not be afraid that I may seem to
      flatter you. It is more of an insult than a compliment to be chosen to
      succeed Vitellius. It is not against the powerful intellect of the sainted
      Augustus that we are in revolt; not against the cautious prudence of the
      old Tiberius; nor even against a long-established imperial family like
      that of Caligula, Claudius or Nero. You even gave way to Galba's ancient
      lineage. To remain inactive any longer, to leave your country to ruin and
      disgrace, that would be sheer sloth and cowardice, even if such slavery
      were as safe for you as it would be dishonourable. The time is long past
      when you could be merely <i>suspected</i> of ambition: the throne is now
      your only refuge. Have you forgotten Corbulo's <a name="1fnm396"></a>murder?<a
      href="#1fn396" class="fnnum">396</a> He was a man of better family than
      we, I admit, but so <a name="1page183"></a><span class="pagenum">183</span>was
      Nero more nobly born than Vitellius. A man who is feared always seems
      illustrious enough to those who fear him. That an army can make an emperor
      Vitellius himself has proved. He had neither experience nor military
      reputation, but merely rose on Galba's unpopularity. Even Otho fell not by
      the strategy or strength of his opponent, but by his own precipitate
      despair. And to-day he seems a great and desirable emperor, when Vitellius
      is disbanding his legions, disarming his Guards, and daily sowing fresh
      seeds of civil war. Why, any spirit or enthusiasm which his army had is
      being dissipated in drunken debauches: for they imitate their master. But
      you, in Judaea, in Syria, in Egypt, you have nine fresh legions. War has
      not weakened nor mutiny demoralized them. The men are trained to
      discipline and have already won a foreign <a name="1fnm397"></a>war.<a
      href="#1fn397" class="fnnum">397</a> Besides these, you can rely on the
      strength of your <a name="1fnm398"></a>fleet,<a href="#1fn398"
      class="fnnum">398</a> and of your auxiliaries both horse and foot, on the
      faithful allegiance of foreign <a name="1fnm399"></a>princes,<a
      href="#1fn399" class="fnnum">399</a> and on your own unparalleled
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap77" id="IIchap77"></a><span class="chapnum">77</span>'For
      ourselves I make but one claim. Let us not rank below Valens and Caecina.
      Nor must you despise my help because you do not encounter my rivalry. I
      prefer myself to Vitellius and you to myself. Your house has received the
      insignia of a <a name="1fnm400"></a>triumph.<a href="#1fn400" class="fnnum">400</a>
      You <a name="1page184"></a><span class="pagenum">184</span>have two young
      sons, one of whom is already old enough to fill the throne, and in his
      first years of service made a name for himself in the German <a
      name="1fnm401"></a>army.<a href="#1fn401" class="fnnum">401</a> It would
      be absurd for me not to give way to one whose son I should adopt, were I
      emperor myself. Apart from this, we shall stand on a different footing in
      success and in failure, for if we succeed I shall have such honour as you
      grant me: of the risk and the dangers we shall share the burden equally.
      Or rather, do what is better still. Dispose your armies yourself and leave
      me the conduct of the war, and the uncertainties of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      'At this moment the defeated are far more strictly disciplined than their
      conquerors. Indignation, hatred, the passion for revenge, all serve to
      steel our courage. Theirs is dulled by pride and mutiny. The course of the
      war will soon bring to light the hidden weakness of their party, and
      reopen all its festering sores. I rely on your vigilance, your economy,
      your wisdom, and still more on the indolence, ignorance, and cruelty of
      Vitellius. Above all, our cause is far safer in war than in peace, for
      those who plan rebellion have rebelled already.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap78" id="IIchap78"></a><span class="chapnum">78</span>At the
      end of Mucianus' speech the others all pressed round with new confidence,
      offering their encouragement and quoting the answers of soothsayers and
      the movements of the stars. Nor was Vespasian uninfluenced by
      superstition. In later days, when he <a name="1page185"></a><span
      class="pagenum">185</span>was master of the world, he made no secret of
      keeping a soothsayer called Seleucus to help him by his advice and
      prophecy. Early omens began to recur to his memory. A tall and conspicuous
      cypress on his estate had once suddenly collapsed: on the next day it had
      risen again on the same spot to grow taller and broader than ever. The
      soothsayers had agreed that this was an omen of great success, and augured
      the height of fame for the still youthful Vespasian. At first his
      triumphal honours, his consulship, and the name he won by his Jewish
      victory seemed to have fulfilled the promise of this omen. But having
      achieved all this, he began to believe that it portended his rise to the
      throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the frontier of Judaea and <a name="1fnm402"></a>Syria<a href="#1fn402"
      class="fnnum">402</a> lies a hill called Carmel. A god of the same name is
      there worshipped according to ancient ritual. There is no image or temple:
      only an altar where they reverently worship. Once when Vespasian was
      sacrificing on this altar, brooding on his secret ambition, the priest,
      Basilides, after a minute inspection of the omens said to him: 'Whatever
      it is which you have in mind, Vespasian, whether it is to build a house or
      to enlarge your estate, or to increase the number of your slaves, there is
      granted to you a great habitation, vast acres, and a multitude of men.'
      Rumour had immediately seized on this riddle and now began to solve it.
      Nothing was more talked of, especially in Vespasian's presence: such
      conversation is the food of hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1page186"></a><span class="pagenum">186</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Having come to a definite decision they departed, Mucianus to Antioch,
      Vespasian to Caesarea. The former is the capital of Syria, the latter of
      <a name="1fnm403"></a>Judaea.<a href="#1fn403" class="fnnum">403</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap79" id="IIchap79"></a><span class="chapnum">79</span>The
      first offer of the throne to Vespasian was made at Alexandria, where
      Tiberius Alexander with great promptitude administered the oath of
      allegiance to his troops on the first of July. This was usually celebrated
      as his day of accession, although it was not until the third that the
      Jewish army took the oath in his presence. So eager was their enthusiasm
      that they would not even wait for the arrival of Titus, who was on his way
      back from Syria, where he had been conducting the negotiations between his
      father and Mucianus.
    </p>
    <p>
      What happened was all due to the impulse of the soldiers: there was no set
      speech, no formal assembly of the troops. <a name="IIchap80" id="IIchap80"></a><span
      class="chapnum">80</span>They were still discussing the time and the
      place, and trying to decide the hardest point of all, who should speak
      first, and while their minds were still busy with hopes and fears, reasons
      and chances, Vespasian happened to come out of his quarters. A few of the
      soldiers, forming up in the usual way to salute their general, saluted him
      as emperor. The others promptly rushed up calling him Caesar and Augustus,
      and heaping on him all the imperial titles. Their fears at once gave way
      to confidence. Vespasian himself, unchanged by the change of fortune,
      showed <a name="1page187"></a><span class="pagenum">187</span>no sign of
      vanity or arrogance. As soon as he had recovered from the dazzling shock
      of his sudden elevation, he addressed them in simple soldier fashion, and
      received a shower of congratulations from every quarter. Mucianus, who had
      been waiting for this, administered the oath of allegiance to his eager
      troops, and then entered the theatre at Antioch, where the Greeks
      ordinarily hold their debates. There, as the fawning crowd came flocking
      in, he addressed them in their own tongue. For he could speak elegant
      Greek, and had the art of making the most of all he said or did. What most
      served to inflame the excitement of the province and of the army, was his
      statement that Vitellius had determined to transfer the German legions to
      peaceful service in the rich province of Syria, and to send the Syrian
      legions to endure the toil and rigours of a winter in Germany. The
      provincials were accustomed to the soldiers' company and liked to have
      them quartered there, and many were bound to them by ties of intimacy and
      kinship, while the soldiers in their long term of service had come to know
      and love their old camp like a home.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap81" id="IIchap81"></a><span class="chapnum">81</span>Before
      the 15th of July the whole of Syria had sworn allegiance. The party also
      gained the support of <a name="1fnm404"></a>Sohaemus,<a href="#1fn404"
      class="fnnum">404</a> with all the resources of his kingdom and a
      considerable force, and of Antiochus,<a href="#1fn404" class="fnnum">404</a>
      the richest of the subject princes, who owed his importance to his
      ancestral treasures. Before long Agrippa, too, received a secret summons
      from his friends at home, and leaving <a name="1page188"></a><span
      class="pagenum">188</span>Rome<a name="1fnm405"></a><a href="#1fn405"
      class="fnnum">405</a> without the knowledge of Vitellius, sailed as fast
      as he could to join Vespasian. His sister <a name="1fnm406"></a>Berenice<a
      href="#1fn406" class="fnnum">406</a> showed equal enthusiasm for the
      cause. She was then in the flower of her youth and beauty, and her
      munificent gifts to Vespasian quite won the old man's heart. Indeed, every
      province on the seaboard as far as Asia and Achaia, and inland to Pontus
      and Armenia swore allegiance to Vespasian, but their governors were
      without troops, for as yet no legions had been assigned to <a
      name="1fnm407"></a>Cappadocia.<a href="#1fn407" class="fnnum">407</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      A meeting was held at <a name="1fnm408"></a>Berytus<a href="#1fn408"
      class="fnnum">408</a> to discuss the general situation. To this came
      Mucianus with all his officers and the most distinguished of his
      centurions and soldiers, besides the elite of the Jewish army in full
      uniform. All these cavalry and infantry, and the pageant of the subject
      princes, vying with each other in splendour, gave the meeting an air of
      imperial grandeur.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap82" id="IIchap82"></a><span class="chapnum">82</span>The
      first step was to levy new troops and to recall the veterans to the
      standards. Some of the strongest towns were told off to manufacture arms.
      New gold and silver were coined at Antioch. All these works were promptly
      carried out, each in the proper place, by competent officials. Vespasian
      came and inspected them himself, encouraging good work by his praises <a
      name="1page189"></a><span class="pagenum">189</span>and rousing the
      inefficient rather by example than compulsion, always more ready to see
      the merits than the faults of his friends. Many were rewarded by receiving
      commands in the auxiliary forces or posts as imperial agents.<a
      name="1fnm409"></a><a href="#1fn409" class="fnnum">409</a> Still more were
      raised to senatorial rank. They were mostly men of distinction who soon
      rose high, and with others success atoned for any lack of merit. A
      donation for the troops had been mentioned by Mucianus in his first
      speech, but in very guarded terms. Even Vespasian offered for the civil
      war a lower figure than others gave in time of peace, for he had set his
      face with admirable firmness against largess to the soldiers, and his army
      was none the worse for it. Envoys were dispatched to Parthia and Armenia
      to secure that the legions, while engaged in the civil war, should not be
      exposed to attack in the <a name="1fnm410"></a>rear.<a href="#1fn410"
      class="fnnum">410</a> It was arranged that Titus should carry on the war
      in Judaea, while Vespasian held the keys of Egypt.<a name="1fnm411"></a><a
      href="#1fn411" class="fnnum">411</a> Against Vitellius it seemed
      sufficient to send a part of their forces under the command of Mucianus.
      He would have Vespasian's name behind him and the <a name="1page190"></a><span
      class="pagenum">190</span>irresistible force of destiny. Letters were
      written to all the armies and their generals with instructions that they
      should try to win over those of the Guards who were hostile to Vitellius
      by promising them renewal of service.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap83" id="IIchap83"></a><span class="chapnum">83</span>Meanwhile,
      Mucianus, who acted the part more of a partner than a subordinate, moved
      forward without the encumbrance of baggage, neither marching so slowly as
      to look like holding back, nor so rapidly as not to allow time for rumours
      to spread. He realized that his force was small, and that the less people
      saw the more they would believe of it. However, he had a solid column
      following in support, composed of the Sixth legion and some picked
      detachments numbering 13,000 <a name="1fnm412"></a>men.<a href="#1fn412"
      class="fnnum">412</a> He had ordered the fleet to move from Pontus to
      Byzantium, for he was half-minded to leave Moesia and with his whole force
      to hold Dyrrachium, at the same time using his fleet to dominate the
      Italian sea. He would thus secure Greece and Asia in his rear, which would
      otherwise be at the mercy of Vitellius, unless furnished with troops.
      Vitellius also would himself be in doubt what points of the Italian coast
      to defend, if Mucianus with his ships threatened both Brundisium and
      Tarentum and the whole coastline of Calabria and Lucania.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap84" id="IIchap84"></a><span class="chapnum">84</span>Thus
      the provinces rang from end to end with the preparations for ships,
      soldiers and arms. But the <a name="1page191"></a><span class="pagenum">191</span>heaviest
      burden was the raising of money. 'Funds,' said Mucianus, 'are the sinews

      in his investigations he cared for neither justice nor equity, but solely
      for the amount of the sum. Informers abounded, and pounced on every rich
      man as their prey. This intolerable oppression, excused by the necessities
      of war, was allowed to continue even in peace. It was not so much that
      Vespasian at the beginning of his reign had made up his mind to maintain
      unjust decisions, but fortune spoilt him; he had learnt in a bad school
      and made a bold use of his lessons. Mucianus also contributed from his
      private means, of which he was generous, as he hoped to get a high rate of
      interest out of the country. Others followed his example, but very few had
      his opportunity of recovering their money.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap85" id="IIchap85"></a><span class="chapnum">85</span>In the
      meantime Vespasian's progress was accelerated by the enthusiasm with which
      the Illyrian <a name="1fnm414"></a>army<a href="#1fn414" class="fnnum">414</a>
      espoused his cause. The Third set the example to the other legions of
      Moesia, the Eighth and the Seventh Claudian, both strongly attached to
      Otho, although they had not been present at the battle. On their arrival
      at <a name="1fnm415"></a>Aquileia<a href="#1fn415" class="fnnum">415</a>
      they had mobbed the couriers who brought the news of Otho's fall, and torn
      to pieces the standards bearing Vitellius' name, finally looting the
      camp-chest and dividing the money among themselves. <a name="1page192"></a><span
      class="pagenum">192</span>These were hostile acts. Alarmed at what they
      had done they began to reflect that, while their conduct needed excuse
      before Vitellius, they could make a merit of it with Vespasian.
      Accordingly, the three Moesian legions addressed letters to the Pannonian
      <a name="1fnm416"></a>army,<a href="#1fn416" class="fnnum">416</a>
      inviting their co-operation, and meanwhile prepared to meet refusal with
      force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aponius Saturninus, the Governor of Moesia, took this opportunity to
      attempt an abominable crime. He sent a centurion to murder Tettius
      Julianus,<a name="1fnm417"></a><a href="#1fn417" class="fnnum">417</a> who
      commanded the Seventh legion, alleging the interests of his party as a
      cloak for a personal quarrel. Julianus heard of his danger and, taking
      some guides who knew the country, escaped into the wilds of Moesia and got
      as far as Mount Haemus.<a name="1fnm418"></a><a href="#1fn418"
      class="fnnum">418</a> After that he meddled no more in civil war. Starting
      to join Vespasian, he prolonged his journey by various expedients,
      retarding or hastening his pace according to the nature of the news he
      received.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap86" id="IIchap86"></a><span class="chapnum">86</span>In
      Pannonia the Thirteenth legion and the Seventh Galbian had not forgotten
      their feelings after the battle of Bedriacum. They lost no time in joining
      Vespasian's cause, being chiefly instigated by Antonius Primus. This man
      was a criminal who had been convicted of <a name="1fnm419"></a>fraud<a
      href="#1fn419" class="fnnum">419</a> during Nero's reign. Among the many
      evils of the war was his recovery of senatorial <a name="1page193"></a><span
      class="pagenum">193</span>rank. Galba gave him command of the Seventh
      legion, and he was believed to have written repeatedly to Otho offering
      his services as general to the party. But, as Otho took no notice of him,
      he was without employment in the war. When Vitellius' cause began to
      decline, he joined Vespasian and proved an acquisition. He was a man of
      great physical energy and a ready tongue; an artist in calumny, invaluable
      in riots and sedition. Light-fingered and free-handed, he was intolerable
      in peace, but by no means contemptible in war. The union of the Moesian
      and Pannonian armies soon attracted the troops in Dalmatia to the cause.
      Tampius Flavianus and Pompeius Silvanus, the two ex-consuls who governed
      respectively Pannonia and <a name="1fnm420"></a>Dalmatia,<a href="#1fn420"
      class="fnnum">420</a> were wealthy old gentlemen who had no thought of
      rising. But the imperial agent in Pannonia, Cornelius Fuscus, was a
      vigorous young man of good family. In his early youth a desire to make
      <a name="1fnm421"></a>money<a href="#1fn421" class="fnnum">421</a> had led
      him to resign his senatorial rank. He <a name="1page194"></a><span
      class="pagenum">194</span>had headed the townsmen of his colony in
      declaring for Galba, and his services had won him a position as imperial
      <a name="1fnm422"></a>agent.<a href="#1fn422" class="fnnum">422</a> Then
      he joined Vespasian's party, giving a keen stimulus to the war; for, being
      attracted more by danger itself than by its prizes, he always disliked
      what was certain and long established, preferring everything that was new
      and dangerous and doubtful. So the Vespasian party used all their efforts
      to fan every spark of discontent throughout the empire. Letters were sent
      to the Fourteenth in Britain and to the First in <a name="1fnm423"></a>Spain,<a
      href="#1fn423" class="fnnum">423</a> since both these legions had stood
      for Otho against Vitellius. In Gaul, too, letters were scattered
      broadcast. All in an instant the war was in full flame. The armies of
      Illyricum openly revolted, and all the others were ready to follow the
      first sign of success.

          imposed some restrictions upon a senator's participation in
          'business'. In the <i>Annals</i> (xvi. 17) Tacitus says that Annaeus
          Mela abstained from seeking public office, because he 'hoped to find a
          shorter road to wealth' by entering, as Fuscus did, the imperial civil
          service. The statement that Fuscus loved danger better than money does
          not imply any rooted antipathy to the latter.

      his generals were showing such activity in the provinces, Vitellius grew
      more contemptible and indolent every day. Halting at every town or country
      house that offered any attractions, he made his way to Rome with a heavy
      marching column of sixty thousand troops, demoralized by loose discipline,
      and an even greater number of menials as well as those camp-followers who
      are more troublesome than any slaves. Besides these he had the vast
      retinue of his generals and friends, which not even the strictest
      discipline could have kept under control. This mob <a name="1page195"></a><span
      class="pagenum">195</span>was further encumbered by senators and knights,
      who came from Rome to meet him, some from fear, some from servility; and
      gradually all the others followed, so as not to be left behind by
      themselves. There flocked in, too, a crowd of low-bred buffoons, actors
      and chariot-drivers, who had gained Vitellius' acquaintance by various
      dishonest services. He delighted in such discreditable connexions. To
      furnish supplies for this host not only were the colonies and country
      towns laid under contribution, but the farmers as well. The crops were
      just ripe and the fields were ravaged like an enemy's country.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap88" id="IIchap88"></a><span class="chapnum">88</span>Many
      murderous affrays took place among the soldiers, for after the mutiny at
      <a name="1fnm425"></a>Ticinum<a href="#1fn425" class="fnnum">425</a> there
      were ceaseless quarrels between the legions and the auxiliaries. They only
      united to harry the villagers. The worst bloodshed took place at the
      seventh milestone from Rome. Here Vitellius had ready-cooked food served
      to each of the soldiers, as is done with gladiators in training, and the
      common people flocked out from Rome and wandered all over the camp. Some
      of these visitors indulged in a cockney practical joke,<a name="1fnm426"></a><a
      href="#1fn426" class="fnnum">426</a> and stole some of the soldiers'
      swords, quietly cutting their belts while their attention was diverted.
      Then they kept asking them, 'Have you got your sword <a name="1page196"></a><span
      class="pagenum">196</span>on?' The troops were not used to being laughed
      at, and refused to tolerate it. They charged the defenceless crowd.
      Amongst others the father of one of the soldiers was killed while in his
      son's company. When it was discovered who he was, and the news spread,
      they shed no more innocent blood. Still there was some panic in the city
      as the first soldiers arrived and began to roam the streets. They mostly
      made for the Forum, anxious to see the spot where Galba had <a
      name="1fnm427"></a>fallen.<a href="#1fn427" class="fnnum">427</a> They
      themselves were a sufficiently alarming sight with their rough skin coats
      and long pikes. Unused to towns, they failed to pick their way in the
      crowd; or they would slip on the greasy streets, or collide with some one
      and tumble down, whereupon they took to abuse and before long to violence.
      Their officers, too, terrified the city by sweeping along the streets with
      their bands of armed men.

      crossing the Mulvian bridge, Vitellius himself had been riding on a
      conspicuous horse, wearing his sword and general's uniform, with the
      senate and people trooping in front of him. However, as this looked too
      much like an entry into a captured city, his friends persuaded him to
      change into civilian dress and walk on foot. At the head of his column
      were carried the eagles of four legions, surrounded by the colours
      belonging to the detachments of four other <a name="1fnm428"></a>legions.<a
      href="#1fn428" class="fnnum">428</a> Next came the standards of twelve
      regiments of <a name="1page197"></a><span class="pagenum">197</span>auxiliary
      horse, then the files of infantry and the cavalry behind them. Then came
      thirty-four cohorts of auxiliaries, arranged according to their
      nationality or the nature of their weapons. In front of the eagles came
      the camp prefects and tribunes, and the senior <a name="1fnm429"></a>centurions,<a
      href="#1fn429" class="fnnum">429</a> all dressed in white. The other
      centurions marched each at the head of his company, glittering with their
      armour and decorations. Gaily, too, shone the soldiers' <a name="1fnm430"></a>medals<a
      href="#1fn430" class="fnnum">430</a> and their chains of honour. It was a
      noble spectacle, an army worthy of a better emperor. Thus Vitellius
      entered the Capitol, where he embraced his mother and conferred on her the
      title of Augusta.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap90" id="IIchap90"></a><span class="chapnum">90</span>On the
      following day Vitellius delivered a grandiloquent eulogy on his own
      merits. He might have been addressing the senate and people of some other
      state, for he extolled his own industry and self-control, although each
      member of his audience had seen his infamy for himself, and the whole of
      Italy had witnessed during his march the shameful spectacle of his sloth
      and luxury. However, the thoughtless crowd could not discriminate between
      truth and falsehood. They had learnt the usual flatteries by heart and
      chimed in with loud shouts of applause. They insisted in the face of his
      protests that he should take the title of <a name="1page198"></a><span
      class="pagenum">198</span>Augustus. But neither his refusal nor their
      insistence made much <a name="1fnm431"></a>difference.<a href="#1fn431"
      class="fnnum">431</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap91" id="IIchap91"></a><span class="chapnum">91</span>In
      Rome nothing passes without comment, and it was regarded as a fatal omen
      that Vitellius took office as high priest, and issued his encyclical on
      public worship on the 18th of July, which, as the anniversary of the
      disasters on the Cremera and the Allia,<a name="1fnm432"></a><a
      href="#1fn432" class="fnnum">432</a> had long been considered an unlucky
      day. But his ignorance of all civil and religious precedent was only
      equalled by the incapacity of his freedmen and friends. He seemed to live
      in a society of drunkards. However, at the consular elections he canvassed
      for his candidates like a common <a name="1fnm433"></a>citizen.<a
      href="#1fn433" class="fnnum">433</a> In everything he courted the favour
      of the lowest classes, attending performances in the theatre and backing
      his favourite at the races. This would undoubtedly have made him popular
      had his motives been good, but the memory of his former life made his
      conduct seem cheap and discreditable. He constantly attended the senate,
      even when the debates were on trivial matters. It once happened that
      Helvidius Priscus,<a name="1fnm434"></a><a href="#1fn434" class="fnnum">434</a>
      then praetor-elect, opposed Vitellius' policy. At first the emperor showed
      annoyance, <a name="1page199"></a><span class="pagenum">199</span>but was
      content to appeal to the tribunes of the people to come to the rescue of
      his slighted authority. Afterwards, when his friends, fearing that his
      resentment might be deep-seated, tried to smooth matters, he replied that
      there was nothing strange in two senators disagreeing on a question of
      public policy: he himself had often opposed even such a man as Thrasea.
      Most people laughed at the impudence of this comparison; others were
      gratified that he had selected Thrasea, and not some court favourite, as
      an example of real <a name="1fnm435"></a>distinction.<a href="#1fn435"
      class="fnnum">435</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap92" id="IIchap92"></a><span class="chapnum">92</span>Vitellius
      had given the command of the Guards to Publilius Sabinus, who had
      commanded an auxiliary <a name="1fnm436"></a>cohort,<a href="#1fn436"
      class="fnnum">436</a> and Julius Priscus, hitherto only a centurion.
      Priscus owed his rise to Valens' support, Sabinus to that of Caecina. The
      rivalry between Valens and Caecina left Vitellius no authority at all.
      They managed the government between them. They had long felt the strain of
      mutual dislike. During the war they had concealed it. Lately it had been
      fanned by dishonest friends and by life in the city, which so easily
      breeds quarrels. They were constant rivals, comparing their respective
      popularity, the number of their retinue, the size of the crowds that came
      to wait upon them. <a name="1page200"></a><span class="pagenum">200</span>Meanwhile
      Vitellius let his favour alternate between them, for personal influence is
      not to be trusted beyond a certain limit. Meanwhile, they both feared and
      despised the emperor himself, who thus veered between sudden brusqueness
      and unseasonable flattery. However, they were not in the least deterred
      from seizing on the houses, gardens, and funds in the emperor's patronage,
      while the crowd of miserable and needy nobles, whom Galba had recalled
      from exile with their children, derived no assistance from the emperor's
      liberality. He earned the approval both of the upper classes and of the
      people by granting to the restored full rights over their <a name="1fnm437"></a>freedmen.<a
      href="#1fn437" class="fnnum">437</a> But the freed slaves with
      characteristic meanness did all they could to invalidate the edict. They
      would hide their money with some obscure friend or in a rich patron's
      safe. Some, indeed, had passed into the imperial household and become more
      influential than their masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap93" id="IIchap93"></a><span class="chapnum">93</span>As for
      the soldiers, the Guards' barracks were crowded, and the overflow spread
      through the city, finding shelter in colonnades and temples. They ceased
      to recognize any head-quarters, to go on guard, or to keep themselves in
      training, but fell victims to the attractions of city life and its
      unmentionable vices, until they deteriorated both physically and morally
      through idleness and debauchery. A number of them <a name="1page201"></a><span
      class="pagenum">201</span>even imperilled their lives by settling in the
      pestilent Vatican quarter, thus increasing the rate of mortality. They
      were close to the Tiber, and the Germans and Gauls, who were peculiarly
      liable to disease and could ill stand the heat, ruined their constitutions
      by their immoderate use of the river.<a name="1fnm438"></a><a
      href="#1fn438" class="fnnum">438</a> Moreover, the generals, either for
      bribes or to earn popularity, tampered with the rules of the service,
      enrolling sixteen regiments of <a name="1fnm439"></a>Guards<a
      href="#1fn439" class="fnnum">439</a> and four for the city garrison, each
      composed of a thousand men. In enlisting these troops Valens put himself
      forward as superior to Caecina, whose life he claimed to have saved. It is
      true, indeed, that his arrival had consolidated the party, and by his
      successful engagement he had silenced the current criticism of their slow
      marching. Besides which the whole of the army of Lower Germany was
      attached to Valens, and this is said to be the reason why Caecina's
      loyalty first wavered.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap94" id="IIchap94"></a><span class="chapnum">94</span>Whatever
      indulgence Vitellius showed to his generals, he allowed still more licence
      to the troops. Each man chose his service. However unfit, he might enlist
      in <a name="1page202"></a><span class="pagenum">202</span>the Guards, if
      he preferred it. On the other hand, good soldiers were allowed, if they
      wished, to remain in the legions or the auxiliary cavalry. Many wished to
      do this who suffered from ill health and complained of the climate.
      However, the best soldiers were thus withdrawn from the legions and from
      the cavalry; and the Guards were robbed of their prestige when twenty
      thousand men were thus not so much selected for service with them as
      drafted at random from the whole army.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Vitellius was addressing the troops, they demanded the execution of
      three Gallic chieftains, Asiaticus, Flavus, and Rufinus, on the ground
      that they had fought for <a name="1fnm440"></a>.<a href="#1fn440"
      class="fnnum">440</a> Vitellius never checked these outcries. For, apart
      from the innate cowardice of his nature, he knew that his donation to the
      soldiers was nearly due, and that he had no money for it; so he freely
      granted all their other demands. The imperial freedmen were forced to
      contribute a sort of tax, proportionate to the number of their slaves.
      Meanwhile, his one serious occupation was extravagance. He built stables
      for chariot-drivers, filled the arena with gorgeous shows of gladiators
      and wild beasts, and fooled away his money as though he had more than he
      wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap95" id="IIchap95"></a><span class="chapnum">95</span>Moreover,
      Valens and Caecina celebrated Vitellius' <a name="1fnm441"></a>birthday<a
      href="#1fn441" class="fnnum">441</a> by holding gladiatorial shows in
      every quarter of Rome on a scale of magnificence hitherto unknown.
      Vitellius then gratified the rabble and scandalized all decent people by
      building altars in the Martian Plain, and holding a funeral service in
      honour of Nero. Victims were killed and burnt in public: the torch was
      applied by the Augustales, members of the college which Tiberius Caesar
      had founded in honour <a name="1page203"></a><span class="pagenum">203</span>of
      the Julian family, just as Romulus similarly commemorated King Tatius.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not yet four months since Vitellius' victory, and yet his freedman
      Asiaticus was as bad as a Polyclitus or a <a name="1fnm442"></a>Patrobius,<a
      href="#1fn442" class="fnnum">442</a> or any of the favourites whose names
      were hated in earlier days. At this court no one strove to rise by honesty
      or capacity. There was only one road to power. By lavish banquets, costly
      profusion, and feats of gastronomy, you had to try and satisfy Vitellius'
      insatiable gluttony. He himself, without thought for the morrow, was well
      content to enjoy the present. It is believed that he squandered nine
      hundred million <a name="1fnm443"></a>sesterces<a href="#1fn443"
      class="fnnum">443</a> in these brief months. Truly it shows Rome's
      greatness and misfortune, that she endured Otho and Vitellius both in the
      same year, and suffered humiliation of every kind at the hands of men like
      Vinius and <a name="1fnm444"></a>Fabius,<a href="#1fn444" class="fnnum">444</a>
      Icelus and Asiaticus, until at last they gave way to Mucianus and
      Marcellus&mdash;a change of men but not of manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap96" id="IIchap96"></a><span class="chapnum">96</span>The
      first news of rebellion which reached Vitellius came from Aponius <a
      name="1fnm445"></a>Saturninus,<a href="#1fn445" class="fnnum">445</a> who,
      before himself going over to Vespasian's side, wrote to announce the
      desertion of the Third legion. But a sudden crisis makes a man nervous:
      Aponius did not tell the whole story. So the emperor's flattering friends
      began to explain it all away: what was the defection of a single legion,
      while the loyalty of the other armies remained <a name="1page204"></a><span
      class="pagenum">204</span>unshaken? Vitellius himself used the same
      language to the soldiers. He accused the men, who had been recently
      discharged from the <a name="1fnm446"></a>Guards,<a href="#1fn446"
      class="fnnum">446</a> of spreading false rumours, and kept assuring them
      there was no fear of civil war. All mention of Vespasian was suppressed,
      and soldiers were sent round the city to frighten people into silence,
      which, of course, did more than anything else to make them talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap97" id="IIchap97"></a><span class="chapnum">97</span>Vitellius,
      nevertheless, sent for reinforcements from Germany, Britain, and the
      Spanish provinces, though with a lack of urgency which was intended to
      conceal his straits. The provinces and their governors showed the same
      want of enthusiasm. Hordeonius Flaccus,<a name="1fnm447"></a><a
      href="#1fn447" class="fnnum">447</a> who had suspicions of the Batavi, was
      distracted with a war of his <a name="1fnm448"></a>own,<a href="#1fn448"
      class="fnnum">448</a> while Vettius <a name="1fnm449"></a>Bolanus<a
      href="#1fn449" class="fnnum">449</a> never had Britain under complete
      control: nor was the loyally of either beyond doubt. The Spanish
      provinces, where there was at the time no consular governor,<a
      name="1fnm450"></a><a href="#1fn450" class="fnnum">450</a> were equally
      slow. The three officers in command of the legions held an equal
      authority, and if Vitellius' cause had prospered, would have each outbid
      the other for his favour: but they all shared the resolve to leave his
      misfortunes alone. In Africa the legion and auxiliaries enlisted by
      Clodius Macer, and subsequently <a name="1page205"></a><span
      class="pagenum">205</span>disbanded by <a name="1fnm451"></a>Galba,<a
      href="#1fn451" class="fnnum">451</a> took service again at Vitellius'
      orders, and at the same time all the young men of the province eagerly
      enlisted. Vitellius had been an honest and popular pro-consul in Africa,
      while Vespasian had been distrusted and disliked. The provincials took
      this as an earnest of their reigns; but experience proved them wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap98" id="IIchap98"></a><span class="chapnum">98</span>The
      military legate Valerius <a name="1fnm452"></a>Festus<a href="#1fn452"
      class="fnnum">452</a> at first loyally seconded the enthusiasm of the
      province. After a while he began to waver. In his official letters and
      edicts he still acknowledged Vitellius, while in secret communication with
      Vespasian and ready to support whichever party proved successful. In
      Raetia and the Gallic provinces some centurions and men carrying letters
      and edicts from Vespasian were taken prisoners and sent to Vitellius, who
      had them executed. But most of these envoys escaped capture either by
      their own ingenuity or the loyal help of friends. Thus, while Vitellius'
      plans were known, Vespasian's were for the most part still a secret. This
      was partly due to Vitellius' negligence, but also to the fact that the
      garrisons on the Pannonian Alps stopped all messengers. By sea, too, the
      <a name="1fnm453"></a>Etesian<a href="#1fn453" class="fnnum">453</a> winds
      from the north-west favoured ships sailing eastward, but hindered the
      voyage from the East.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="1page206"></a><span class="pagenum">206</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap99" id="IIchap99"></a><span class="chapnum">99</span>Terrified
      at last by the imminence of invasion and the alarming news that reached
      him from all quarters, Vitellius instructed Caecina and Valens to prepare
      for war. Caecina was sent on ahead, Valens, who was just recovering from a
      serious illness, being delayed by his weak state of health. Great, indeed,
      was the change in the appearance of the German army as it marched out of
      Rome. There was neither energy in their muscles nor fire in their hearts.
      Slowly the column straggled on, their horses spiritless, their arms
      neglected. The men grumbled at the sun, the dust, the weather, and were as
      ready to quarrel as they were unwilling to work. To these disadvantages
      were added Caecina's inveterate self-seeking and his newly-acquired
      indolence. An overdose of success had made him slack and self-indulgent,
      or, if he was plotting treachery, this may have been one of his devices
      for demoralizing the army. It has often been believed that it was Flavius
      <a name="1fnm454"></a>Sabinus<a href="#1fn454" class="fnnum">454</a> who,
      using Rubrius Gallus as his agent, tampered with Caecina's loyalty by
      promising that, if he came over, Vespasian would ratify any conditions. It
      may have occurred also to Caecina to remember his quarrels and rivalry
      with Valens, and to consider that, as he did not stand first with
      Vitellius, he had better acquire credit and influence with the new
      emperor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIchap100" id="IIchap100"></a><span class="chapnum">100</span>After
      taking an affectionate and respectful farewell of Vitellius, Caecina
      dispatched a body of cavalry to occupy Cremona. He soon followed with the
      <a name="1page207"></a><span class="pagenum">207</span>detachments of the
      First, Fourth, Fifteenth, and Sixteenth legions in the van. The centre was
      composed of the Fifth and Twenty-second, and in the rear of the column
      came the Twenty-first Rapax and the First Italian legion, with detachments
      from the three legions of Britain and a select force of auxiliaries. When
      Caecina had started, Valens wrote instructions to the legions belonging to
      his old <a name="1fnm455"></a>command<a href="#1fn455" class="fnnum">455</a>
      to await him on the march, saying that he and Caecina had arranged this.
      Caecina, however, took advantage of being on the spot, and pretended that
      this plan had been altered so as to enable them to meet the first outbreak
      of the war with their full strength. So some legions were hurried forward
      to <a name="1fnm456"></a>Cremona<a href="#1fn456" class="fnnum">456</a>
      and part of the force was directed upon <a name="1fnm457"></a>Hostilia.<a
      href="#1fn457" class="fnnum">457</a> Caecina himself turned aside to
      Ravenna on the pretext of giving instructions to the fleet. Thence he
      proceeded to <a name="1fnm458"></a>Patavium<a href="#1fn458" class="fnnum">458</a>
      to secure secrecy for his treacherous designs. For Lucilius Bassus, whom
      Vitellius, from a prefect of auxiliary cavalry had raised to the supreme
      command of the two fleets at Ravenna and Misenum, felt aggrieved at not
      being immediately given the praefecture of the Guards, and sought in
      dastardly treachery the remedy for his unjustifiable annoyance. It can
      never be known whether he influenced Caecina or whether one was as
      dishonest as the other. There is seldom much to <a name="1page208"></a><span
      class="pagenum">208</span>choose between rascals. <a name="IIchap101"
      id="IIchap101"></a><span class="chapnum">101</span>The <a name="1fnm459"></a>historians<a
      href="#1fn459" class="fnnum">459</a> who compiled the records of this war
      in the days of the Flavian dynasty were led by flattery into adducing as
      the causes of the rebellion patriotism and the interests of peace. We
      cannot think them right. Apart from the innate disloyalty of the rebels
      and the loss of character after Galba's betrayal, they seem to have been
      led by jealousy and rivalry into sacrificing Vitellius himself for fear
      that they might lose the first place in his favour. Thus when Caecina
      joined his <a name="1fnm460"></a>army,<a href="#1fn460" class="fnnum">460</a>
      he used every device to undermine the staunch fidelity of the centurions
      and soldiers to Vitellius. Bassus found the same task less difficult, for
      the fleet remembered that they had lately been in Otho's service, and were
      therefore already on the brink of rebellion.

    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap1" id="IIIchap1"></a><span class="chapnum">1</span>On the
      Flavian side the generals concerted their plans for the war with greater
      loyalty and greater success. They had met at <a name="2fnm1"></a>Poetovio<a
      href="#2fn1" class="fnnum">1</a> at the head-quarters of the Third legion,
      where they debated whether they should block the passage of the Pannonian
      Alps and wait until their whole strength came up to reinforce them, or
      whether they should take a bolder line, assume the offensive, and strike
      for Italy. Those who were in favour of waiting for reinforcements and
      prolonging the war dwelt on the strength and reputation of the German
      legions, and pointed out that the flower of the British army had lately
      arrived in Rome with Vitellius;<a name="2fnm2"></a><a href="#2fn2"
      class="fnnum">2</a> their own forces were numerically inferior and had
      recently suffered defeat; moreover, conquered troops, however bold their
      language, never show the same courage. On the other hand, if they occupied
      the Alps, Mucianus would soon arrive with the forces from the East.
      Besides, Vespasian <a name="2fnm3"></a>still<a href="#2fn3" class="fnnum">3</a>
      commanded the sea, and could count on the support of the <a name="2fnm4"></a>fleets<a
      href="#2fn4" class="fnnum">4</a> and of the provinces, <a name="2page10"></a><span
      class="pagenum">10</span>where he could still raise material for a sort of
      second war. A salutary delay would bring them fresh forces without in any
      way prejudicing their present position.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap2" id="IIIchap2"></a><span class="chapnum">2</span>In
      answer to these arguments Antonius <a name="2fnm5"></a>Primus,<a
      href="#2fn5" class="fnnum">5</a> who had done more than any one else to
      stir up the war, stoutly maintained that prompt action would save them and
      ruin Vitellius. 'Their victory,' he said, 'has not served to inspirit but
      to enervate them. The men are not held in readiness in camp, but are
      loitering in towns all over Italy. No one but their hosts has any call to
      fear them. The more unruly and ferocious they showed themselves before,
      the greater the greed with which they now indulge in unwonted draughts of
      pleasure. The circus, the theatre, and the charms of the capital have
      ruined their hardness and their health. But if we give them time to train
      for war they will regain their energy. It is not far to Germany, whence
      they draw their main strength. Britain is only separated by a narrow
      channel. Close at hand they have Gaul and Spain, from the provinces of
      which they can get men, horses, and subsidies. Then again, they can rely
      on Italy itself and all the resources of the capital, while, if they want
      to take the offensive, they have two <a name="2fnm6"></a>fleets<a
      href="#2fn6" class="fnnum">6</a> and full command of the Illyrian <a
      name="2fnm7"></a>Sea.<a href="#2fn7" class="fnnum">7</a> Besides, what
      good to us are the ramparts of the mountains? Why should we drag on the
      war into another summer? Where can we get funds and supplies in the
      meanwhile? No, let us seize our opportunity. The Pannonian legions are
      <a name="2page11"></a><span class="pagenum">11</span>burning to rise in
      revenge. They were not defeated but <a name="2fnm8"></a>deceived.<a
      href="#2fn8" class="fnnum">8</a> The Moesian army has not yet lost a man.
      If you count not legions but men, our forces are superior both in numbers
      and in character. The very shame of our <a name="2fnm9"></a>defeat<a
      href="#2fn9" class="fnnum">9</a> makes for good discipline. And even then
      our cavalry was not beaten. For though we lost the day, they shattered the
      enemy's line.<a name="2fnm10"></a><a href="#2fn10" class="fnnum">10</a>
      And what was the force that broke through the Vitellians? Two regiments of
      cavalry from Pannonia and Moesia. What have we now? Sixteen regiments.
      Will not their combined forces, as they roar and thunder down upon the
      enemy, burying them in clouds of dust, overwhelm these horses and horsemen
      that have forgotten how to fight? I have given you my plan, and, unless I
      am stopped, I will put it in operation. Some of you have not yet burnt
      your <a name="2fnm11"></a>boats.<a href="#2fn11" class="fnnum">11</a>
      Well, you can keep back the legions. Give me the auxiliaries in light
      marching order. They will be enough for me. You will soon hear that the
      door of Italy is open and the power of Vitellius shaken. You will be glad
      enough to follow in the footsteps of my victory.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap3" id="IIIchap3"></a><span class="chapnum">3</span>All
      this and much else of the same tenor Antonius poured out with flashing
      eyes, raising his voice so as to reach the centurions and some of the
      soldiers, who had gathered round to share in their deliberations.<a
      name="2fnm12"></a><a href="#2fn12" class="fnnum">12</a> His truculent tone
      carried away even the more cautious <a name="2page12"></a><span
      class="pagenum">12</span>and far-seeing, while the rest of the crowd were
      filled with contempt for the cowardice of the other generals, and cheered
      their one and only leader to the echo. He had already established his
      reputation at the original meeting, when Vespasian's <a name="2fnm13"></a>letter<a
      href="#2fn13" class="fnnum">13</a> was read. Most of the generals had then
      taken an ambiguous line, intending to interpret their language in the
      light of subsequent events. But Antonius seemed to have taken the field
      without any disguise, and this carried more weight with the men, who saw
      that he must share their disgrace or their glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap4" id="IIIchap4"></a><span class="chapnum">4</span>Next to
      Antonius in influence stood Cornelius Fuscus, the imperial <a name="2fnm14"></a>agent.<a
      href="#2fn14" class="fnnum">14</a> He, too, always attacked Vitellius in
      no mild terms, and had left himself no hope in case of failure. Tampius
      <a name="2fnm15"></a>Flavianus<a href="#2fn15" class="fnnum">15</a> was a
      man whose disposition and advanced years inclined him to dilatory
      measures, and he soon began to earn the dislike and suspicion of the
      soldiers, who felt he had not forgotten his kinship with Vitellius.
      Besides this, when the legions first rose, he had fled to Italy and
      subsequently returned of his own free will, which looked like meditating
      <a name="2fnm16"></a>treachery.<a href="#2fn16" class="fnnum">16</a>
      Having once given up his province and returned to Italy, he was out of the
      reach of danger, but the passion for revolution had induced him to resume
      his title and meddle in the civil war. It was Cornelius Fuscus who had
      persuaded him to <a name="2page13"></a><span class="pagenum">13</span>this&mdash;not
      that he needed his assistance, but because he felt that, especially at the
      outset of the rising, the prestige of an ex-consul would be a valuable
      asset to the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap5" id="IIIchap5"></a><span class="chapnum">5</span>In
      order to make their march across into Italy safe and effective, letters
      were sent to Aponius <a name="2fnm17"></a>Saturninus<a href="#2fn17"
      class="fnnum">17</a> to bring the Moesian army up as quickly as possible.
      To prevent the exposure of the defenceless provinces to the attacks of
      foreign tribes, the chiefs of the Sarmatian <a name="2fnm18"></a>Iazyges,<a
      href="#2fn18" class="fnnum">18</a> who formed the government of the tribe,
      were enlisted in the service. They also offered their tribal force,
      consisting entirely of cavalry, but were excused from this contribution
      for fear that the civil war might give opportunity for a foreign invasion,
      or that an offer of higher pay from the enemy might tempt them to
      sacrifice their duty and their <a name="2fnm19"></a>honour.<a href="#2fn19"
      class="fnnum">19</a> Sido and Italicus, two princes of the <a name="2fnm20"></a>Suebi,<a
      href="#2fn20" class="fnnum">20</a> were allowed to join Vespasian's side.
      They had long acknowledged Roman sovereignty, and companionship in <a
      name="2fnm21"></a>arms<a href="#2fn21" class="fnnum">21</a> was likely to
      strengthen the loyalty of the tribe. Some auxiliaries were stationed on
      the flank towards Raetia, where hostilities were expected, since <a
      name="2page14"></a><span class="pagenum">14</span>the imperial agent
      Porcius <a name="2fnm22"></a>Septiminus,<a href="#2fn22" class="fnnum">22</a>
      remained incorruptibly loyal to Vitellius. Sextilius Felix was therefore
      dispatched with Aurius' <a name="2fnm23"></a>Horse<a href="#2fn23"
      class="fnnum">23</a> and eight cohorts of auxiliary infantry, together
      with the native levies of Noricum, to hold the line of the river <a
      name="2fnm24"></a>Aenus,<a href="#2fn24" class="fnnum">24</a> which forms
      the frontier of Raetia and Noricum. Neither side provoked a battle: the
      fortune of the rival parties was decided elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap6" id="IIIchap6"></a><span class="chapnum">6</span>Meanwhile,
      at the head of a picked band of auxiliaries and part of the cavalry,
      Antonius hurried off to invade Italy. He took with him an energetic
      soldier named Arrius Varus, who had made his reputation while serving
      under Corbulo in his Armenian victories. He was supposed to have sought a
      private interview with Nero, at which he maligned Corbulo's character. His
      infamous treachery brought him the emperor's favour and a post as senior
      centurion. This ill-gotten prize delighted him now, but ultimately proved
      his <a name="2fnm25"></a>ruin.<a href="#2fn25" class="fnnum">25</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      After occupying <a name="2fnm26"></a>Aquileia,<a href="#2fn26"
      class="fnnum">26</a> Antonius and Varus found a ready welcome at
      Opitergium and <a name="2fnm27"></a>Altinum<a href="#2fn27" class="fnnum">27</a>
      and all the other towns in the neighbourhood. At Altinum a garrison was
      left behind to guard their communications against the fleet at Ravenna,
      for the news of its desertion had not as yet arrived. Pressing forward,
      they won Patavium and <a name="2fnm28"></a>Ateste<a href="#2fn28"
      class="fnnum">28</a> for the party.<a name="2page15"></a><span
      class="pagenum">15</span> At the latter place they learnt that three
      cohorts of Vitellius' auxiliary infantry and a regiment of cavalry, known
      as Sebosus' <a name="2fnm29"></a>Horse,<a href="#2fn29" class="fnnum">29</a>
      were established at Forum <a name="2fnm30"></a>Alieni,<a href="#2fn30"
      class="fnnum">30</a> where they had constructed a <a name="2fnm31"></a>bridge.<a
      href="#2fn31" class="fnnum">31</a> The report added that they were off
      their guard, so this seemed a good opportunity to attack them. They
      accordingly rushed the position at dawn, and cut down many of the men
      without their weapons. Orders had been given that, after a few had been
      killed, the rest should be terrorized into desertion. Some surrendered at
      once, but the majority succeeded in destroying the bridge, and thus
      checked the enemy's pursuit. The first bout had gone in the Flavians'
      favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap7" id="IIIchap7"></a><span class="chapnum">7</span>When
      the news spread to Poetovio, the Seventh Galbian and the Thirteenth Gemina
      hurried in high spirits to Patavium under the command of Vedius Aquila. At
      Patavium they were given a few days' rest, during which Minicius Justus,
      the camp-prefect of the Seventh legion, who endeavoured to enforce a
      standard of discipline too severe for civil war, had to be rescued from
      the fury of his troops and sent to Vespasian. Antonius conceived that his
      party would gain in prestige, if they showed approval of Galba's
      government, and stood for the revival of his cause. So he gave orders that
      all the statues of Galba, which had been thrown down during the civil war,
      should be replaced for worship throughout the country towns.<a
      name="2page16"></a><span class="pagenum">16</span> This was a thing that
      had long been desired, and in their ambitious imaginations it assumed an
      undue importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap8" id="IIIchap8"></a><span class="chapnum">8</span>The
      question then arose where they should choose their seat of war. The best
      place seemed to be Verona. The open country round it was suited for the
      man&oelig;uvres of the cavalry, in which their strength lay: and they
      would gain both prestige and profit by wresting from Vitellius a strongly
      garrisoned town. On the road they occupied <a name="2fnm32"></a>Vicetia.<a
      href="#2fn32" class="fnnum">32</a> In itself this was a very small matter,
      since there was only a moderate force in the town, but it gained
      considerable importance from the reflection that it was Caecina's
      birthplace: the enemy's general had thus lost his native town. But Verona
      was well worth while. The inhabitants could aid the party with
      encouragement and funds: the army was thrust midway between Raetia and the
      Julian <a name="2fnm33"></a>Alps,<a href="#2fn33" class="fnnum">33</a> and
      had thus blocked all passages by that route for the German armies.
    </p>
    <p>
      This move had been made either without the knowledge or against the orders
      of Vespasian. His instructions were to suspend operations at Aquileia and
      wait for the arrival of Mucianus. He had further added this consideration,
      that so long as he held Egypt and the key to the corn-supply,<a
      name="2fnm34"></a><a href="#2fn34" class="fnnum">34</a> as well as the
      revenue of the richest provinces,<a name="2fnm35"></a><a href="#2fn35"
      class="fnnum">35</a> he could reduce Vitellius' army to submission from
      sheer lack of money and provisions. Mucianus had sent letter after letter
      <a name="2page17"></a><span class="pagenum">17</span>with the same advice,
      pointing to the prospect of a victory without bloodshed or bereavement,
      and using other similar pretexts to conceal his real motive. This was
      ambition. He wanted to keep all the glory of the war to himself. However,
      the distance was so great that events outran his instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap9" id="IIIchap9"></a><span class="chapnum">9</span>Antonius
      accordingly made a sudden sally against the enemy's outposts, and after a
      slight skirmish, in which they tested each other's temper, both sides
      withdrew without advantage. Soon after, Caecina entrenched a strong
      position between a Veronese village called <a name="2fnm36"></a>Hostilia<a
      href="#2fn36" class="fnnum">36</a> and the marshes of the river Tartaro.
      Here he was safe, with the river in his rear and the marsh to guard his
      flanks. Had he added loyalty to his other advantages, he might have
      employed the full strength of the Vitellian forces to crush the enemy's
      two legions, before they were reinforced by the Moesian army, or, at
      least, have forced them to retire in ignominious flight and abandon Italy.
      But Caecina used various pretexts for delay, and at the outset of the war
      treacherously yielded all his advantages to the enemy. While it was open
      to him to rout them by force of arms, he preferred to pester them with
      letters and to wait until his intermediaries had settled the terms of his
      treason. In the meantime, Aponius Saturninus arrived with the Seventh
      Claudian legion,<a name="2fnm37"></a><a href="#2fn37" class="fnnum">37</a>
      commanded by the <a name="2fnm38"></a>tribune<a href="#2fn38" class="fnnum">38</a>
      Vipstanus Messala, a distinguished member <a name="2page18"></a><span
      class="pagenum">18</span>of a famous family, and the only man who brought
      any honesty to this <a name="2fnm39"></a>war.<a href="#2fn39" class="fnnum">39</a>
      To these forces, still only three legions and no match for the Vitellians,
      Caecina addressed his letters. He criticized their rash attempt to sustain
      a lost cause, and at the same time praised the courage of the German army
      in the highest terms. His allusions to Vitellius were few and casual, and
      he refrained from insulting Vespasian. In fact he used no language
      calculated either to seduce or to terrorize the enemy. The Flavian
      generals made no attempt to explain away their former defeat. They proudly
      championed Vespasian, showing their loyalty to the cause, their confidence
      in the army, and their hostile <a name="2fnm40"></a>prejudice<a
      href="#2fn40" class="fnnum">40</a> against Vitellius. To the tribunes and
      centurions they held out the hope of retaining all the favours they had
      won from Vitellius, and they urged Caecina himself in plain terms to
      desert. These letters <a name="2page19"></a><span class="pagenum">19</span>were
      both read before a meeting of the Flavian army, and served to increase
      their confidence, for while Caecina wrote mildly and seemed afraid of
      offending Vespasian, their own generals had answered contemptuously and
      scoffed at Vitellius.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap10" id="IIIchap10"></a><span class="chapnum">10</span>When
      the two other legions arrived, the <a name="2fnm41"></a>Third<a
      href="#2fn41" class="fnnum">41</a> commanded by Dillius Aponianus, and the
      Eighth by Numisius Lupus, Antonius decided to entrench Verona and make a
      demonstration in force. It so happened that the Galbian legion, who had
      been told off to work in the trenches facing the enemy, catching sight of
      some of their allies' cavalry in the distance, took them for the enemy,
      and fell into a groundless panic. Suspecting treachery, they seized their
      arms and visited their fury on Tampius <a name="2fnm42"></a>Flavianus.<a
      href="#2fn42" class="fnnum">42</a> They could prove no charge against him,
      but he had long been unpopular, and a blind impulse made them clamour for
      his head. He was Vitellius' kinsman, they howled; he had betrayed Otho; he
      had embezzled their donative. They would listen to no defence, although he
      implored them with outstretched hands, grovelling for the most part flat
      upon the ground, his clothes all torn, his face and chest shaken with
      sobs. This only served to inflame the soldiers' anger. His very excess of
      terror seemed to prove his guilt. <a name="2fnm43"></a>Aponius<a
      href="#2fn43" class="fnnum">43</a> tried to address them, but his voice
      was drowned in their shouts. The others, too, were contemptuously howled
      down. They would give no one a hearing except Antonius, who had the power
      of <a name="2page20"></a><span class="pagenum">20</span>authority as well
      as the arts of eloquence necessary to quiet a mob. When the riot grew
      worse, and they began to pass from insulting speeches to murderous
      violence, he gave orders that Flavianus should be put in chains. Feeling
      that this was a <a name="2fnm44"></a>farce,<a href="#2fn44" class="fnnum">44</a>
      the soldiers broke through the guards round the general's quarters,
      prepared to resort to extremities. Whereupon Antonius, drawing his sword,
      bared his breast and vowed that he would die either by their hands or his
      own. Whenever he saw a soldier whom he knew or could recognize by his
      decorations, he called on him by name to come to the rescue. At last he
      turned towards the standards and the gods of <a name="2fnm45"></a>war,<a
      href="#2fn45" class="fnnum">45</a> and prayed incessantly that they would
      rather inspire the enemy's army with this mad spirit of mutiny. At last
      the riot died away and at nightfall they all dispersed to their tents.
      Flavianus left that same night, and on his way met letters from Vespasian,
      which delivered him from danger.

      <a name="IIIchap11" id="IIIchap11"></a><span class="chapnum">11</span>The
      infection seemed to spread among the legions. They next attacked Aponius
      Saturninus, who was in command of the Moesian army. This fresh disturbance
      was caused by the circulation of a letter, which Saturninus was supposed
      to have written to Vitellius, and it was the more alarming since it broke
      out not when they were tired by their labours but in the <a name="2page21"></a><span
      class="pagenum">21</span>middle of the day. Once the soldiers had vied
      with each other in courage and discipline: now they were rivals in
      ribaldry and riot. They were determined that the fury with which they
      denounced Aponius should not fall short of their outcry against Flavianus.
      The Moesian legions remembered that they had helped the Pannonian army to
      take their revenge; while the Pannonian troops, feeling that their
      comrades' mutiny acquitted them of blame, were glad enough to repeat the
      crime. They invaded the country house in which Saturninus was living. He
      escaped, however, aided not so much by the efforts of Antonius, Aponianus,
      and Messala, who did everything in their power to rescue him, but rather
      by the security of his hiding-place, for he concealed himself in the
      furnace of some disused baths. Eventually he gave up his lictors and
      retired to Patavium. The departure of both the consular governors left
      Antonius in supreme command of the two armies. His <a name="2fnm46"></a>colleagues<a
      href="#2fn46" class="fnnum">46</a> deferred to him and the men gave him
      enthusiastic support. It was even supposed by some that he had cunningly
      promoted both outbreaks, to secure for himself the full profit of the war.

          The text here is doubtful. There seems to be no exact parallel to the
          absolute use of <i>praesumpsere</i>. In the Medicean MS. the whole
          passage, from <i>revirescere</i> at the end of chap. <a
          href="#IIIchap7">7</a> down to <i>inimici</i> here, has been
          transposed to the beginning of chap. <a href="#IIIchap5">5</a>, where
          it stands between the second and third syllables of the word <i>Saturnino</i>.
          Thus in M. <i>praesumpsere</i> stands immediately after <i>partes</i>.
          It is possible that the word <i>partes</i> may belong to this passage
          as well as to the end of chap. <a href="#IIIchap7">7</a>. <i>Praesumpsere
          partes</i> would mean 'they took their own cause for granted' (cp.
          Quintilian xi. 1. 27). The addition of <i>ut inimici</i> would add the
          sense of 'hostile prejudice'.

      was equally a prey to disquiet, and there the dissension was the more
      fatal, since it was aroused not by the men's suspicions but by the <a
      name="2page22"></a><span class="pagenum">22</span>treachery of the
      generals. The sailors of the fleet at Ravenna were mostly drawn from the
      provinces of Dalmatia and Pannonia, which were both held for Vespasian,
      and while they were still wavering, the admiral, Lucilius Bassus, decided
      them in favour of the Flavian party. Choosing the night-time for their
      treason, the conspirators assembled at head-quarters without the knowledge
      of the other sailors. Bassus, who was either ashamed or uncertain of their
      success, awaited developments in his house. Amid great disturbance the
      ships' captains attacked the images of Vitellius and cut down the few men
      who offered any resistance. The rest of the fleet were glad enough of a
      change, and their sympathies soon came round to Vespasian. Then Lucilius
      appeared and publicly claimed responsibility. The fleet appointed
      Cornelius <a name="2fnm48"></a>Fuscus<a href="#2fn48" class="2fnnum">48</a>
      as their admiral, and he came hurrying on to the scene. Bassus was put
      under honourable arrest and conveyed with an escort of Liburnian <a
      name="2fnm49"></a>cruisers<a href="#2fn49" class="2fnnum">49</a> to <a
      name="2fnm50"></a>Atria,<a href="#2fn50" class="2fnnum">50</a> where he
      was imprisoned by Vibennius Rufinus, who commanded a regiment of auxiliary
      horse in garrison there. However, he was soon set free on the intervention
      of Hormus, one of the emperor's freedmen. For he, too, ranked as a
      general.

    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap13" id="IIIchap13"></a><span class="chapnum">13</span>When
      the news that the navy had gone over became known, Caecina, carefully
      selecting a moment when the camp was deserted, and the men had all gone to
      their various duties, summoned to head-quarters the senior centurions and
      a few of the soldiers. He then proceeded <a name="2page23"></a><span
      class="pagenum">23</span>to praise the spirit and the strength of
      Vespasian's party: 'they themselves had been deserted by the fleet; they
      were cramped for supplies; Spain and Gaul were against them; Rome could
      not be trusted.' In every way he exaggerated the weakness of Vitellius'
      position. Eventually, when some of his accomplices had given the cue and
      the rest were dumbfoundered by his change of front, he made them all swear
      allegiance to Vespasian. Immediately the <a name="2fnm51"></a>portraits<a
      href="#2fn51" class="2fnnum">51</a> of Vitellius were torn down and
      messengers dispatched to Antonius. However, when the treason got abroad in
      the camp, and the men returning to head-quarters saw Vespasian's name on
      the standards and Vitellius' portraits scattered on the ground, at first
      there was an ominous silence: then with one voice they all vented their
      feelings. Had the pride of the German army sunk so low that without a
      battle and without a blow they should let their hands be shackled and
      render up their arms? What had they against them? None but defeated
      troops. The only sound legions of Otho's army, the First and the
      Fourteenth, Vespasian had not got, and even those they had routed and cut
      to pieces on that same field. And all for what? That these thousands of
      fighting men should be handed over like a drove of slaves to Antonius, the
      convict!<a name="2fnm52"></a><a href="#2fn52" class="2fnnum">52</a> 'Eight
      legions, forsooth, are to follow the lead of one miserable fleet. Such is
      the pleasure of Bassus and Caecina. They have robbed the emperor of his

      troops.<a name="2page24"></a><span class="pagenum">24</span> We have never

      they shouted one and all as their indignation urged them. Led by the Fifth
      legion, they replaced the portraits of Vitellius and put Caecina in irons.
      They selected Fabius Fabullus, commanding the Fifth legion, and the
      camp-prefect, Cassius Longus, to lead them. Some marines who arrived at
      this point from three Liburnian <a name="2fnm53"></a>cruisers,<a
      href="#2fn53" class="2fnnum">53</a> quite innocent and unaware of what had
      happened, were promptly butchered. Then the men deserted their camp, broke
      down the <a name="2fnm54"></a>bridge,<a href="#2fn54" class="2fnnum">54</a>
      and marched back to Hostilia, and thence to Cremona to join the two
      legions, the First Italian and Twenty-first Rapax, which Caecina had sent
      <a name="2fnm55"></a>ahead<a href="#2fn55" class="2fnnum">55</a> with some
      of the cavalry to occupy Cremona.

    <h3>
      <a name="The_Engagement" id="The_Engagement"></a>The Engagement near
      Cremona
    </h3>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap15" id="IIIchap15"></a><span class="chapnum">15</span>When
      Antonius heard of this he determined to attack the enemy while they were
      still at variance and their forces divided. The Vitellian generals would
      soon recover their authority and the troops their discipline, and
      confidence would come if the two divisions were allowed to join. He
      guessed also that Fabius Valens had already started from Rome and would
      hasten his march when he heard of Caecina's <a name="2page25"></a><span
      class="pagenum">25</span>treachery. Valens was loyal to Vitellius and an
      experienced soldier. There was good reason, besides, to fear an attack on
      the side of Raetia from an immense force of German irregulars. Vitellius
      had already summoned auxiliaries from Britain, Gaul, and Spain in
      sufficient numbers to blight their chances utterly, had not Antonius in
      fear of this very prospect forestalled the victory by hurriedly forcing an
      engagement. In two days he marched his whole force from Verona to <a
      name="2fnm56"></a>Bedriacum.<a href="#2fn56" class="2fnnum">56</a> On the
      next <a name="2fnm57"></a>day<a href="#2fn57" class="2fnnum">57</a> he
      left his legions behind to fortify the camp, and sent out his auxiliary
      infantry into territory belonging to Cremona, to taste the joys of
      plundering their compatriots under pretext of collecting supplies. To
      secure greater freedom for their depredations, he himself advanced at the
      head of four thousand cavalry eight miles along the road from Bedriacum.
      The scouts, as is usual, turned their attention further afield.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap16" id="IIIchap16"></a><span class="chapnum">16</span>About
      eleven in the morning a mounted scout galloped up with the news that the
      enemy were at hand; there was a small body in advance of the rest, but the
      noise of an army in movement could be heard over the country-side. While
      Antonius was debating what he ought to do, Arrius Varus, who was greedy to
      distinguish himself, galloped out with the keenest of the troopers and
      charged the Vitellians, inflicting only slight loss; for, on the arrival
      of reinforcements, the tables were turned and those who had been hottest
      in pursuit were now hindmost in the rout. Their <a name="2page26"></a><span
      class="pagenum">26</span>haste had no sanction from Antonius, who had
      foreseen what would happen. Encouraging his men to engage with brave
      hearts, he drew off the cavalry on to each flank and left a free passage
      in the centre to receive Varus and his troopers. Orders were sent to the
      legions to arm and signals were displayed to the foraging party, summoning
      them to cease plundering and join the battle by the quickest possible
      path. Meanwhile Varus came plunging in terror into the middle of their
      ranks, spreading confusion among them. The fresh troops were swept back
      along with the wounded, themselves sharing the panic and sorely
      embarrassed by the narrowness of the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap17" id="IIIchap17"></a><span class="chapnum">17</span>In
      all the confusion of the rout Antonius never for a moment forgot what
      befitted a determined general and a brave soldier. Staying the
      panic-stricken, checking the fugitives, wherever the fight was thickest,
      wherever he saw a gleam of hope, he schemed, he fought, he shouted, always
      conspicuous to his own men and a mark for the enemy. At last, in the heat
      of his impatience, he thrust through with a lance a standard-bearer, who
      was in full flight, then seized the standard and turned it against the
      enemy. Whereupon for very shame a few of his troopers, not more than a
      hundred, made a stand. The nature of the ground helped them. The road
      there was narrower; a stream barred their way, and the bridge was broken;
      its depth was uncertain and the steep banks checked their flight. Thus
      necessity or chance restored their fallen fortunes. Forming in close
      order, they received <a name="2page27"></a><span class="pagenum">27</span>the
      Vitellians' reckless and disordered charge, and at once flung them into
      confusion. Antonius pressed hard on the fugitives and cut down all who
      blocked his path. The others followed each his inclination, rifling the
      dead, capturing prisoners, seizing arms and horses. Meanwhile, summoned by
      their shouts of triumph, those who had just now been in full flight across
      the fields came hurrying back to share the victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap18" id="IIIchap18"></a><span class="chapnum">18</span>Four
      miles from Cremona they saw the standards of the Rapax and Italian legions
      gleaming in the sun. They had marched out thus far under cover of their
      cavalry's original success. When fortune turned against them, they neither
      opened their ranks to receive the routed troops nor marched out to attack
      the enemy, who were wearied with fighting and their long pursuit. While
      all went well the Vitellians did not miss their general, but in the hour
      of danger they realized their loss. The victorious cavalry came charging
      into their wavering line, and at the same time Vipstanus Messala arrived
      with the Moesian auxiliaries and a good number of men from the legions,
      who had kept up with the pace of their forced <a name="2fnm58"></a>march.<a
      href="#2fn58" class="2fnnum">58</a> These combined forces broke the
      opposing column, and the proximity of Cremona's sheltering walls gave the
      Vitellians more hope of refuge and less stomach for resistance.

    <h3>
      <a name="The_Fate" id="The_Fate"></a>The Fate of Cremona
    </h3>
    <p>
      Antonius did not follow up his advantage. He realized that, although the
      issue had been successful, the battle had long been doubtful, and had cost
      the troopers and their horses many wounds and much hard fighting. <a
      name="IIIchap19" id="IIIchap19"></a><span class="chapnum">19</span>As
      evening fell, the whole strength of the Flavian army arrived. They had
      marched among heaps of corpses, and the still reeking traces of slaughter,
      and now, feeling that the war was over, they clamoured to advance at once
      on Cremona and either receive its submission or take it by storm. This
      sounded well for public utterance, but each man in his heart was thinking,
      'We could easily rush a city on the plain. In a night-assault men are just
      as brave and have a better chance of plunder. If we wait for day it will
      be all peace and petitions, and what shall we get for our wounds and our
      labours? A reputation for mercy! There's no money in that. All the wealth
      of Cremona will find its way into the officers' pockets. Storm a city, and
      the plunder goes to the soldiers: if it surrenders, the generals get it.'
      They refused to listen to their centurions and tribunes and drowned their
      voices in a rattle of arms, swearing they would break their orders unless
      they were led out. <a name="IIIchap20" id="IIIchap20"></a><span
      class="chapnum">20</span>Antonius then went round among the companies,
      where his authoritative bearing obtained silence. He assured them that he
      had no wish to rob them of the glory and the reward they so well deserved.
      'But,' he said, 'an army and a general have different functions. It is
      right that soldiers <a name="2page29"></a><span class="pagenum">29</span>should
      be greedy for battle, but the general often does more good not by temerity
      but by foresight, deliberation and delay. I have done all I could to aid
      your victory with my sword: now I will serve you by the general's proper
      arts of calculation and strategy. The risks that face us are obvious. It
      is night; we know nothing of the lie of the city; the enemy are behind the
      walls; everything favours an ambush. Even if the gates were open, we
      cannot safely enter except by day and after due reconnoitring. Are you
      going to begin storming the town when you cannot possibly see where the
      ground is level and how high the walls are? How do you know whether to
      assault it with engines and showers of missiles, or with penthouses and
      shelters?'<a name="2fnm59"></a><a href="#2fn59" class="2fnnum">59</a> Then
      he turned to individuals, asking one after another whether they had
      brought hatchets and pick-axes and other implements for storming a town.
      When they answered no, 'Well,' he said, 'could any troops possibly break
      through walls or undermine them with nothing but swords and javelins?
      Suppose it proves necessary to construct a mound and to shelter ourselves
      with mantlets and fascines,<a href="#2fn59" class="2fnnum">59</a> are we
      going to stand idle like a lot of helpless idiots, gaping at the height of
      the enemy's towers and ramparts? Why not rather wait one night till our
      siege-train arrives and then carry the victory by force?' So saying, he
      sent the camp-followers and servants with the freshest of the troopers
      back to Bedriacum to bring up supplies and whatever else was wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="2page30"></a><span class="pagenum">30</span><a name="IIIchap21"
      id="IIIchap21"></a><span class="chapnum">21</span>The soldiers indeed
      chafed at this and mutiny seemed imminent, when some of the mounted
      scouts, who had ridden right up to the walls, captured a few stragglers
      from Cremona, and learnt from them that six Vitellian legions and the
      whole Hostilia army had that very day covered thirty miles, and, hearing
      of their comrades' defeat, were already arming for battle and would be on
      them immediately. This alarming news cured their obstinate deafness to the
      general's advice. He ordered the Thirteenth legion to take up their
      position on the raised Postumian high-road. In touch with them on the left
      wing in the open country were the Seventh Galbian, beside whom stood the
      Seventh Claudian, so placed that their front was protected by a ditch. On
      the right wing were the Eighth, drawn up along an open cross-road, and
      next to them the Third, distributed among some thick clumps of trees.
      Such, at any rate, was the order of the eagles and standards. In the
      darkness the soldiers were confused and took their places at random. The
      band of <a name="2fnm60"></a>Guards<a href="#2fn60" class="2fnnum">60</a>
      was next to the Third, and the auxiliaries on the wings, while the cavalry
      were disposed in support round the flanks and the rear. Sido and Italicus
      with their picked band of <a name="2fnm61"></a>Suebi<a href="#2fn61"
      class="2fnnum">61</a> fought in the front line.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap22" id="IIIchap22"></a><span class="chapnum">22</span>For
      the Vitellians the right course was to rest at Cremona and recuperate
      their strength with food and a night's rest, and then on the next day to
      crush and <a name="2page31"></a><span class="pagenum">31</span>rout the
      Flavians when they were stiff with cold and weak from hunger. But they had
      no general;<a name="2fnm62"></a><a href="#2fn62" class="2fnnum">62</a>
      they had no plan. Though it was nearly nine at night they flung themselves
      upon the Flavians, who were standing steady in their places to receive
      them. In their fury and the darkness the Vitellian line was so disordered
      that one can hardly venture to describe the disposition of their troops.
      However, it has been stated that the Fourth Macedonian legion were on the
      right flank; in the centre were the Fifth and Fifteenth with the
      detachments of the Ninth, the Second and the Twentieth from Britain; the
      Sixteenth, the Twenty-second, and the First formed the left wing. The men
      of the Rapax and Italian <a name="2fnm63"></a>legions<a href="#2fn63"
      class="2fnnum">63</a> were distributed among all the companies.<a
      name="2fnm64"></a><a href="#2fn64" class="2fnnum">64</a> The cavalry and
      auxiliaries picked their own position. All night the battle raged with
      varying fortune, never decided, always savagely contested. Disaster
      threatened now one side, now the other. Courage, strength were of little
      use: their eyes could not even see in front of them. Both sides were armed
      alike; the watchwords, constantly demanded, soon became known; the
      standards were all in confusion, as they were captured and carried off
      from one band to another. The Seventh legion, raised recently by Galba,
      suffered most severely. Six of the senior centurions fell and several <a
      name="2page32"></a><span class="pagenum">32</span>standards were lost.
      They nearly lost their eagle too, but it was rescued by the bravery of the
      senior centurion, named Atilius Verus, who after great slaughter of the
      enemy fell finally himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap23" id="IIIchap23"></a><span class="chapnum">23</span>Antonius
      had meanwhile called up the Guards to reinforce his wavering line. Taking
      up the fight, they repulsed the enemy, only to be repulsed in their turn.
      For the Vitellian artillery, which had at first been scattered all along
      the line, and had been discharged upon the bushes without hurting the
      enemy, was now massed upon the high-road, and swept the open space in
      front. One immense engine in particular, which belonged to the Fifteenth,
      mowed down the Flavian line with huge stones. The slaughter thus caused
      would have been enormous, had not two of the Flavian soldiers performed a
      memorable exploit. Concealing their identity by snatching up shields from
      among the enemy's <a name="2fnm65"></a>dead,<a href="#2fn65" class="2fnnum">65</a>
      they cut the ropes which suspended the weights of the engine. They fell
      immediately, riddled with wounds, and so their names have perished. But of
      their deed there is no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortune had favoured neither side when, as the night wore on, the moon
      rose and threw a deceptive glamour over the field of battle. Shining from
      behind the Flavians the moon was in their favour. It magnified the shadows
      of their men and horses so that the enemy took the shadow for the
      substance, and their <a name="2page33"></a><span class="pagenum">33</span>missiles
      were misdirected and fell short. The Vitellians, on the other hand, had
      the moon shining full on them and were an easy mark for the Flavians,
      shooting as it were out of <a name="2fnm66"></a>cover.<a href="#2fn66"
      class="2fnnum">66</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap24" id="IIIchap24"></a><span class="chapnum">24</span>Thus
      being enabled to recognize his own men, and to be recognized by them,
      Antonius appealed to some by taunting their honour, to many by words of
      praise and encouragement, to all by promising hope of reward. He asked the
      Pannonian legions why they had drawn their swords again. Here on this
      field they could regain their glory and wipe out the stain of their former
      <a name="2fnm67"></a>disgrace.<a href="#2fn67" class="2fnnum">67</a> Then
      turning to the Moesian troops, who were the chief promoters of the <a
      name="2fnm68"></a>war,<a href="#2fn68" class="2fnnum">68</a> he told them
      it was no good challenging the Vitellians with verbal threats, if they
      could not bear to face them and their blows. Thus he addressed each legion
      as he reached it. To the Third he spoke at greater length, reminding them
      of their victories both old and new. Had they not under Mark Antony
      defeated the <a name="2fnm69"></a>Parthians<a href="#2fn69" class="2fnnum">69</a>
      and the Armenians under <a name="2fnm70"></a>Corbulo?<a href="#2fn70"
      class="2fnnum">70</a> Had they not but lately crushed the <a name="2fnm71"></a>Sarmatians?<a
      href="#2fn71" class="2fnnum">71</a> Then he turned in fury on the Guards.
      'Peasants that you are,' he shouted, 'have you another emperor, another
      camp waiting to shelter you, if you are defeated? There in the enemy's
      line are your standards <a name="2page34"></a><span class="pagenum">34</span>and
      your arms: defeat means death and&mdash;no, you have drained disgrace
      already to the dregs.'
    </p>
    <p>
      These words roused cheers on all sides, and the Third, following the
      Syrian <a name="2fnm72"></a>custom,<a href="#2fn72" class="2fnnum">72</a>
      saluted the rising sun. <a name="IIIchap25" id="IIIchap25"></a><span
      class="chapnum">25</span>Thus arose a casual rumour&mdash;or possibly it
      was suggested by the general's ingenuity&mdash;that Mucianus had arrived,
      and that the two armies were cheering each other. On they pressed, feeling
      they had been reinforced. The Vitellian line was more ragged now, for,
      having no general to marshal them, their ranks now filled, now thinned,
      with each alternation of courage and fear. As soon as Antonius saw them
      waver, he kept thrusting at them in massed column. The line bent and then
      broke, and the inextricable confusion of wagons and siege-engines
      prevented their rallying. The victorious troops scattered along the
      cross-road in headlong pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The slaughter was marked by one peculiar horror. A son killed his father.
      I give the facts and names on the authority of Vipstanus Messala.<a
      name="2fnm73"></a><a href="#2fn73" class="2fnnum">73</a> One Julius
      Mansuetus, a Spaniard who had joined the legion Rapax, had left a young
      son at home. This boy subsequently grew up and enlisted in the Seventh
      legion, raised by <a name="2fnm74"></a>Galba.<a href="#2fn74"
      class="2fnnum">74</a> Chance now sent his father in his way, and he felled
      him to the ground. While he was ransacking the dying man, they recognized
      each other. Flinging his arms round the now lifeless corpse, in <a
      name="2page35"></a><span class="pagenum">35</span>a piteous voice he
      implored his father's spirit to be appeased and not to turn against him as
      a parricide. The crime was his country's, he cried; what share had a
      single soldier in these civil wars? Meanwhile he lifted the body and began
      to dig a grave and perform the last rites for his father. Those who were
      nearest noticed this; then the story began to spread, till there ran
      through the army astonishment and many complaints and curses against this
      wicked war. Yet they never ceased busily killing and plundering friends
      and relatives and brothers; and while they talked of the crime they were
      committing it themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap26" id="IIIchap26"></a><span class="chapnum">26</span>When
      they reached Cremona a fresh task of vast difficulty awaited them. During
      the war with <a name="2fnm75"></a>Otho<a href="#2fn75" class="2fnnum">75</a>
      the German army had entrenched their camp round the walls of Cremona and
      then erected a rampart round the camp; and these fortifications had been
      further strengthened. The sight of them brought the victors to a halt, and
      their generals were uncertain what instructions to give. The troops had
      had no rest for a day and a night. To storm the town at once would be an
      arduous and, in the absence of reserves, a perilous task. On the other
      hand, a retreat to Bedriacum would involve the intolerable fatigue of a
      long march, and destroy the value of their victory. Again, it would be
      dangerous to entrench themselves so close to the lines of the enemy, who
      might at any minute sally forth and rout them while they were dispersed
      and digging trenches. The chief anxiety lay in the temper <a name="2page36"></a><span
      class="pagenum">36</span>of the men, who were much more ready to face
      danger than delay. To them discretion was disagreeable and hazard spelt
      hope. Their thirst for plunder outweighed all fears of wounds and
      bloodshed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap27" id="IIIchap27"></a><span class="chapnum">27</span>Antonius
      also inclined to this view and gave orders for them to surround the
      rampart. At first they stood back and delivered volleys of arrows and
      stones, suffering themselves the severer loss, for a storm of missiles
      rained down from the walls. Antonius then told off each legion to assault
      a different point of the rampart or one of the gates, hoping that by thus
      separating them he could distinguish the cowards from the brave and
      inflame them with a spirit of honourable rivalry. The Third and Seventh
      took the position nearest the road to Bedriacum; the Eighth and Seventh
      Claudian assaulted the right-hand side of the rampart; the Thirteenth
      swept up to the Brixian <a name="2fnm76"></a>Gate.<a href="#2fn76"
      class="2fnnum">76</a> A brief delay was caused while some fetched mattocks
      and pickaxes from the fields, and others hooks and ladders. Then holding
      their shields above their heads in close 'tortoise' <a name="2fnm77"></a>formation,<a
      href="#2fn77" class="2fnnum">77</a> they advanced under the rampart. Both
      sides employed Roman tactics. The Vitellians rolled down huge masses of
      stones, and, as the sheltering cover of shields parted and wavered, they
      thrust at it with lances and poles, until at last <a name="2page37"></a><span
      class="pagenum">37</span>the whole structure was broken up and they mowed
      down the torn and bleeding soldiers beneath with terrible slaughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men would certainly have hesitated, had not the generals, realizing
      that they were really too tired to respond to any other form of
      encouragement, pointed significantly to Cremona. <a name="IIIchap28"
      id="IIIchap28"></a><span class="chapnum">28</span>Whether this was
      Hormus's idea, as <a name="2fnm78"></a>Messala<a href="#2fn78"
      class="2fnnum">78</a> records, or whether we should rather follow Caius
      Pliny, who accuses Antonius, it is not easy to determine. This one may
      say, that, however abominable the crime, yet in committing it neither
      Antonius nor Hormus belied the reputation of their lives. After this
      neither wounds nor bloodshed could stay the Flavian troops. They
      demolished the rampart, shook the gates, climbed up on each other's
      shoulders, or over the re-formed 'tortoise', and snatched away the enemy's
      weapons or caught hold of them by the arms. Thus the wounded and
      unwounded, the half-dead and the dying, all came rolling down and perished
      together by every imaginable kind of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap29" id="IIIchap29"></a><span class="chapnum">29</span>The
      fight raged thickest round the Third and Seventh legions, and the general,
      Antonius, came up with a picked band of auxiliaries to support their
      assault. The Vitellians, finding themselves unable to resist the attack of
      troops thus stubbornly vying with each other, and seeing their missiles
      all glide off the shelter of shields, at last sent their engine of war
      crashing down upon their heads. For the moment it <a name="2page38"></a><span
      class="pagenum">38</span>scattered and crushed beneath it the men on whom
      it fell, but it dragged with it some of the battlements and the top of the
      rampart. At the same moment one of the towers on the rampart gave way
      under a shower of stones. While the men of the Seventh struggled up to the
      breach in close column,<a name="2fnm79"></a><a href="#2fn79" class="2fnnum">79</a>
      the Third hewed down the gate with hatchets and swords. All the <a
      name="2fnm80"></a>authorities<a href="#2fn80" class="2fnnum">80</a> agree
      that Caius Volusius of the Third legion was the first man in. Emerging on
      the top of the rampart, he hurled down those who barred his path, and from
      this conspicuous position waved his hand and shouted that the camp was
      taken. The others poured through, while the Vitellians in panic flung
      themselves down from the rampart, and the whole space between the camp and
      the walls became a seething scene of carnage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap30" id="IIIchap30"></a><span class="chapnum">30</span>Here,
      again, was a new type of task for the Flavians. Here were high walls,
      stone battlements, iron-barred gates, and soldiers hurling javelins. The
      citizens of Cremona were numerous and devoted to the cause of Vitellius,
      and half Italy had gathered there for the Fair which fell just at that
      time. Their numbers were a help to the defenders, but the prospect of
      plundering them offered an incentive to their assailants. Antonius ordered
      his men to bring fire and apply it to the most beautiful of the buildings
      outside the walls, hoping that the loss of their property might induce the
      citizens to turn traitor. The houses that stood nearest to <a
      name="2page39"></a><span class="pagenum">39</span>the walls and overtopped
      them he crowded with his bravest troops, who dislodged the defenders with
      showers of beams and tiles and flaming torches. <a name="IIIchap31"
      id="IIIchap31"></a><span class="chapnum">31</span>Meanwhile, some of the
      legionaries began to advance in 'tortoise' <a name="2fnm81"></a>formation,<a
      href="#2fn81" class="2fnnum">81</a> while others kept up a steady fire of
      javelins and stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually the spirit of the Vitellians ebbed. The higher their rank, the
      more easily they gave way to misfortune. For they were afraid that if
      Cremona <a name="2fnm82"></a>too<a href="#2fn82" class="2fnnum">82</a> was
      demolished, there would be no hope of pardon; the victors' fury would fall
      not on the common poor but on the tribunes and centurions, whom it would
      pay to kill. The common soldiers felt safe in their obscurity, and,
      careless of the future, continued to offer resistance. They roamed the
      streets or hid themselves in houses, and though they had given up the war,
      refused even so to sue for peace. Meanwhile the tribunes and centurions
      did away with the name and portraits of <a name="2fnm83"></a>Vitellius.<a
      href="#2fn83" class="2fnnum">83</a> They released Caecina, who was still
      in <a name="2fnm84"></a>irons,<a href="#2fn84" class="2fnnum">84</a> and
      begged his help in pleading their cause. When he turned from them in
      haughty contempt they besought him with tears. It was, indeed, the last of
      evils that all these brave men should invoke a traitor's aid. They then
      hung veils and <a name="2fnm85"></a>fillets<a href="#2fn85" class="2fnnum">85</a>
      out on the walls, and when Antonius had given the order to cease <a
      name="2page40"></a><span class="pagenum">40</span>firing, they carried out
      their standards and eagles, followed by a miserable column of disarmed
      soldiers, dejectedly hanging their heads. The victors had at first crowded
      round, heaping insults on them and threatening violence, but when they
      found that the vanquished had lost all their proud spirit, and turned
      their cheeks with servile endurance to every indignity, they gradually
      began to recollect that these were the men who had made such a moderate
      use of their victory at <a name="2fnm86"></a>Bedriacum.<a href="#2fn86"
      class="2fnnum">86</a> But when the crowd parted, and Caecina advanced in
      his consular robes, attended by his lictors in full state, their
      indignation broke into flame. They charged him with insolence and cruelty,
      and&mdash;so hateful is crime&mdash;they even flung his treachery in his
      <a name="2fnm87"></a>teeth.<a href="#2fn87" class="2fnnum">87</a> Antonius
      restrained them and sent Caecina under escort to Vespasian.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap32" id="IIIchap32"></a><span class="chapnum">32</span>Meanwhile
      the citizens of Cremona suffered sorely from the violence of the troops,
      and only the entreaties of their generals could withhold them from a
      general massacre. Antonius summoned a mass meeting and delivered a eulogy
      upon his victorious army, promising mercy to the vanquished and speaking
      of Cremona in ambiguous terms. Besides their natural passion for plunder,
      there was an old grudge which urged them to sack Cremona. The town was
      believed to have given assistance to the Vitellian cause before this in
      the war with Otho;<a name="2fnm88"></a><a href="#2fn88" class="2fnnum">88</a>
      and again, when the Thirteenth <a name="2page41"></a><span class="pagenum">41</span>had
      been left behind to build an <a name="2fnm89"></a>amphitheatre,<a
      href="#2fn89" class="2fnnum">89</a> the populace had shown its town-bred
      impertinence by assailing them with insolent ridicule. Other causes
      increased this bad feeling: it was here that Caecina had given his show of
      gladiators:<a href="#2fn89" class="2fnnum">89</a> the town had become for
      a second time the theatre of the war: the citizens had conveyed food to
      the Vitellians during the battle: some women had been killed, whose
      enthusiasm for the cause had led them to take part in the fight. Besides
      all this, the Fair had filled the rich city with an even greater display
      of wealth than usual. All eyes were now centred on Antonius, whose fame
      and good fortune overshadowed all the other generals. It so happened that
      he hurried off to the baths to wash off the stains of blood. Finding fault
      with the temperature of the water, he received the answer, 'It will not be
      long before it is hot,' and this phrase was caught up. The attendant's
      words were repeated, and brought all the odium on Antonius, who was thus
      believed to have given the signal to set fire to Cremona, which was
      already in <a name="2fnm90"></a>flames.<a href="#2fn90" class="2fnnum">90</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap33" id="IIIchap33"></a><span class="chapnum">33</span>Thus
      forty thousand soldiers burst into the town with a yet larger crowd of
      servants and sutlers, even more depraved than the soldiers in their
      readiness for cruelty and lust. Without any respect for age or for <a
      name="2page42"></a><span class="pagenum">42</span>authority they added
      rape to murder and murder to rape. Aged men and decrepit old women, who
      were worthless as booty, were hustled off to make sport for them. If some
      grown girl or a handsome youth fell into their clutches, they would be
      torn to pieces in the struggle for possession, while the plunderers were
      left to cut each other's throats. Whoever carried off money or any of the
      solid gold offerings in the temples was liable to be cut to pieces, if he
      met another stronger than himself. Some, disdaining easy finds, hunted for
      hidden hoards, and dug out buried treasure, flogging and torturing the
      householders. They held torches in their hands and, having once secured
      their prize, would fling them wantonly into an empty house or some
      dismantled temple. Composed as the army was of citizens, allies, and
      foreign troops, differing widely in language and customs, the objects of
      the soldiers' greed differed also. But while their views of what was right
      might vary, they all agreed in thinking nothing wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cremona lasted them four days. While all other buildings sacred and
      secular sank in the flames, only the temple of Mefitis outside the walls
      was left standing, saved either by its position or the power of the
      presiding <a name="2fnm91"></a>deity.<a href="#2fn91" class="2fnnum">91</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap34" id="IIIchap34"></a><span class="chapnum">34</span>Such
      was the end of Cremona two hundred and eighty-six years after its
      foundation. It had been originally built in the consulship of Tiberius
      Sempronius and Publius Cornelius, while Hannibal was <a name="2page43"></a><span
      class="pagenum">43</span>threatening to invade Italy, to serve as a
      bulwark against the Gauls beyond the <a name="2fnm92"></a>Po,<a
      href="#2fn92" class="2fnnum">92</a> and to resist any other power that
      might break in over the Alps. And so it grew and flourished, aided by its
      large number of settlers, its conveniently situated rivers,<a name="2fnm93"></a><a
      href="#2fn93" class="2fnnum">93</a> the fertility of its territory, and
      its connexion through alliance and intermarriage with other communities.
      Foreign invasions had left it untouched only to become the victim of civil
      war. Antonius, ashamed of his crime, and realizing his growing disfavour,
      proclaimed that no citizen of Cremona was to be kept as a prisoner of war;
      and, indeed, the unanimous feeling in Italy against buying such slaves had
      already frustrated the soldiers' hope of profit. So they began to kill
      their captives, whose relatives and friends, when this became known,
      covertly bought their release. After a while, the rest of the inhabitants
      returned, and the squares and temples were rebuilt by the munificence of
      the burghers and under Vespasian's direct patronage.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap35" id="IIIchap35"></a><span class="chapnum">35</span>However,
      the soil was so foully infected by the reek of blood that it was
      impossible for the Flavians to encamp for long on the ruins of this buried
      city. They advanced along the road to the third milestone, and mustered
      the Vitellians, still straggling and panic-stricken, each under his own
      standard. The defeated legions were then distributed through Illyricum,
      for the civil war was still in progress and their fidelity <a
      name="2page44"></a><span class="pagenum">44</span>could not be relied on.
      They then dispatched couriers to carry the news to Britain and the Spanish
      provinces. To Gaul they sent an officer named Julius Calenus, to Germany
      Alpinius Montanus, who had commanded an auxiliary cohort. Montanus was a
      Treviran and Calenus an Aeduan; both had fought for Vitellius and thus
      served to advertise Vespasian's victory. At the same time garrisons were
      sent to hold the passes of the Alps, for fear that Germany might rise in
      support of Vitellius.

      <a name="Vitellius" id="Vitellius"></a>Vitellius
    </h3>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap36" id="IIIchap36"></a><span class="chapnum">36</span>When
      Caecina had left <a name="2fnm94"></a>Rome,<a href="#2fn94" class="2fnnum">94</a>
      Vitellius, after an interval of a few days, sent Fabius Valens hurrying to
      the front, and then proceeded to drown his cares in self-indulgence. He
      neither made any provision for the war, nor tried to increase the
      efficiency of his troops either by haranguing or by drilling them. He did
      not keep himself in the public eye, but retired into the pleasant shade of
      his gardens, regarding past, present, and future with equal indifference,
      like one of those listless animals which lie sluggish, and torpid so long
      as you supply them with food. While he thus loitered languid and indolent
      in the woods of <a name="2fnm95"></a>Aricia,<a href="#2fn95" class="2fnnum">95</a>
      he received the startling news of Lucilius Bassus' treachery and the
      disaffection of the fleet at <a name="2fnm96"></a>Ravenna.<a href="#2fn96"
      class="2fnnum">96</a> Soon afterwards he heard with mixed feelings of
      distress and satisfaction that Caecina had deserted him and had been
      imprisoned by the <a name="2page45"></a><span class="pagenum">45</span>army.
      On his insensate nature joy had more effect than trouble. He returned in
      triumph to Rome and at a crowded meeting praised the devotion of the
      troops in extravagant terms. He gave orders for the imprisonment of
      Publilius Sabinus, the prefect of the Guards, on the ground of his
      intimacy with Caecina, and appointed Alfenus <a name="2fnm97"></a>Varus<a
      href="#2fn97" class="2fnnum">97</a> in his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap37" id="IIIchap37"></a><span class="chapnum">37</span>He
      next delivered a pompous and elaborate speech in the senate, where he was
      loaded with far-fetched compliments by the members. Lucius Vitellius rose
      to propose a harsh sentence against Caecina. The rest of the house
      inveighed with assumed indignation against the consul who had betrayed his
      country, the general who had betrayed his commander-in-chief, the friend
      who had betrayed his benefactor to whom he owed all his riches and
      distinction. But their protestations of sympathy with Vitellius really
      voiced their personal <a name="2fnm98"></a>vexation.<a href="#2fn98"
      class="2fnnum">98</a> None of the speeches contained any criticism of the
      Flavian generals. They threw the blame on the misguided and impolitic
      action of the armies, and with cautious circumlocution avoided all direct
      mention of Vespasian. Caecina's <a name="2fnm99"></a>consulship<a
      href="#2fn99" class="2fnnum">99</a> had still one day to run, and Rosius
      Regulus actually made humble petition for this one day's office,
      Vitellius' offer and his acceptance exciting universal derision. Thus he
      entered and abdicated his office on the same day, the last of October. Men
      who were learned in constitutional history pointed out <a name="2page46"></a><span
      class="pagenum">46</span>that no one before had ever been elected to fill
      a vacancy without the passing of a bill or some act of deprivation,
      although there was precedent for the one day consulship in the case of
      Caninius Rebilus when Caius Caesar was dictator and the civil war
      necessitated prompt rewards.<a name="2fnm100"></a><a href="#2fn100"
      class="2fnnum">100</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap38" id="IIIchap38"></a><span class="chapnum">38</span>It
      was at this time that the news of the death of Junius <a name="2fnm101"></a>Blaesus<a
      href="#2fn101" class="2fnnum">101</a> gave rise to much talk. I give the
      story as I find it. When Vitellius was lying seriously ill at his house in
      the Servilian Park, he noticed that a neighbouring mansion was brilliantly
      illuminated at night. On asking the reason, he was told that Caecina <a
      name="2fnm102"></a>Tuscus<a href="#2fn102" class="2fnnum">102</a> was
      giving a large dinner-party, at which Junius Blaesus was the chief guest.
      He further received an exaggerated account of their extravagance and
      dissipation. Some of his informants even made specific charges against
      Tuscus and others, but especially accused Blaesus for spending his days in
      revelry while <a name="2page47"></a><span class="pagenum">47</span>his
      emperor lay ill. There are people who keep a sharp eye on every sign of an
      emperor's displeasure. They soon made sure that Vitellius was furious and
      that Blaesus' ruin would be an easy task, so they cast Lucius Vitellius
      for the part of common informer. He had a mean and jealous dislike for
      Blaesus, whose spotless reputation far outshone his own, which was tainted
      with every kind of infamy. Bursting into the emperor's apartment, he
      caught up Vitellius' young son in his arms and fell at his feet. When
      asked the reason of this excitement, he said it was due to no anxiety for
      himself; all his suit and all his prayers were for his brother and his
      brother's children. Their fears of Vespasian were idle: between him and
      Vitellius lay all the legions of Germany, all those brave and loyal
      provinces, and an immeasurable space of land and sea. 'It is here in
      Rome,' he cried, 'in the bosom of our household that we have an enemy to
      fear, one who boasts the Junii and Antonii as his ancestors, one who shows
      himself affable and munificent to the troops, posing as a descendant of
      imperial stock.<a name="2fnm103"></a><a href="#2fn103" class="2fnnum">103</a>
      It is to him that Rome's attention turns, while you, Sire, careless who is
      friend or foe, cherish in your bosom a rival, who sits feasting at his
      table and watches his emperor in pain. You must requite his unseasonable
      gaiety with a night of deadly sorrow, in which he <a name="2page48"></a><span
      class="pagenum">48</span>may both know and feel that Vitellius lives and
      is his emperor, and, if anything should happen, has a son to be his heir.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap39" id="IIIchap39"></a><span class="chapnum">39</span>Vitellius
      hesitated anxiously between his criminal desires and his fear that, if he
      deferred Blaesus' death, he might hasten his own ruin, or by giving
      official orders for it might raise a storm of indignation. He decided to
      proceed by poison. The suspicion against him he confirmed by going to see
      Blaesus and showing obvious satisfaction. Moreover, he was heard to make
      the savage boast that he had, to quote his own words, 'feasted his eyes on
      his enemy's deathbed.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Blaesus, besides his distinguished origin and refined character, was
      steadfastly loyal. Even before the decline of Vitellius' cause he had been
      canvassed by Caecina and other party leaders, who were turning against the
      emperor, and had met them with a persistent refusal. He was a man of quiet
      and blameless life, with no ambition for the principate or, indeed, for
      any sudden distinction, but he could not escape the danger of being
      considered worthy of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap40" id="IIIchap40"></a><span class="chapnum">40</span>Meanwhile
      Fabius Valens, encumbered by a long train of harlots and eunuchs, was
      conducting a leisurely advance, most unlike a march to the front, when
      couriers arrived post-haste with the news that Lucilius Bassus had
      surrendered the Ravenna <a name="2fnm104"></a>fleet.<a href="#2fn104"
      class="2fnnum">104</a> If he had hurried forward on his march he might
      have been in time to save Caecina's faltering loyalty, or to have joined
      the legions before the critical engagement was <a name="2page49"></a><span
      class="pagenum">49</span>fought. Many, indeed, advised him to avoid
      Ravenna and to make his way by obscure by-roads to Hostilia or Cremona.
      Others wanted him to send to Rome for the Guards and to break through the
      enemy's lines with a strong force. Valens himself, with helpless
      indecision, let the time for action go by while he took advice; and then
      rejecting the advice he was offered, chose the middle course, which is
      always the worst in a crisis, and thus failed both in courage and in
      caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap41" id="IIIchap41"></a><span class="chapnum">41</span>He
      wrote to Vitellius demanding reinforcements, and there arrived three
      cohorts of Guards and a regiment of cavalry from Britain, too many to slip
      through unobserved and too few to force a passage. But even in such a
      crisis as this Valens' reputation was as unsavoury as ever. He was still
      believed to use violence in the pursuit of illicit pleasures, and to
      betray the confidence of his hosts by seducing their wives and families.
      He had money and authority to help him, and the feverish impatience of one
      whose star is on the wane. At last the arrival of the reinforcements
      revealed the perversity of his strategy. He had too few men to assume the
      offensive, even if they had been unquestionably loyal, and their loyalty
      was under grave suspicion. However, their sense of decency and respect for
      the general restrained them for a while, though such ties are soon broken
      when troops are disinclined for danger and indifferent to <a name="2fnm105"></a>disgrace.<a
      href="#2fn105" class="2fnnum">105</a> Fearing trouble, he sent the Guards
      forward to<a name="2page50"></a><span class="pagenum">50</span> <a
      name="2fnm106"></a>Ariminum<a href="#2fn106" class="2fnnum">106</a> with
      the cavalry to secure the rear. Valens himself, with a few companions,
      whose loyalty had survived misfortune, turned off into Umbria and thence
      to Etruria, where he learnt the result of the battle of Cremona. Thereupon
      he formed a plan, which was far from cowardly and might have had alarming
      consequences, if it had succeeded. He was to seize ships and cross to some
      point on the coast of Narbonnese Gaul, whence he could rouse the provinces
      of Gaul and the native German tribes, and thus raise forces for a fresh
      outbreak of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap42" id="IIIchap42"></a><span class="chapnum">42</span>Valens'
      departure having dispirited the troops at Ariminum, Cornelius <a
      name="2fnm107"></a>Fuscus<a href="#2fn107" class="2fnnum">107</a> advanced
      his force and, stationing <a name="2fnm108"></a>Liburnian<a href="#2fn108"
      class="2fnnum">108</a> cruisers along the adjoining coast, invested the
      town by land and sea. The Flavians thus occupied the Umbrian plain and the
      sea-board of Picenum; and the Apennines now divided Italy between
      Vitellius and Vespasian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valens, embarking from the Bay of Pisa, was either becalmed on a slow sea
      or caught by an unfavourable wind and had to put in at the harbour of
      Hercules <a name="2fnm109"></a>Monoecus.<a href="#2fn109" class="2fnnum">109</a>
      Stationed in the neighbourhood was Marius Maturus, the Governor of the
      Maritime <a name="2fnm110"></a>Alps,<a href="#2fn110" class="2fnnum">110</a>
      who had remained loyal to Vitellius, and, though surrounded by enemies,
      had so far been faithful to his oath of allegiance. He gave Valens a
      friendly welcome and strongly advised him not to venture rashly into
      Narbonnese Gaul. This alarmed<a name="2page51"></a><span class="pagenum">51</span>
      Valens, who found also that his companions' loyalty was yielding to their
      fears. <a name="IIIchap43" id="IIIchap43"></a><span class="chapnum">43</span>For
      Valerius Paulinus, the imperial agent in the province, was an energetic
      soldier who had been friendly with Vespasian in old days, and had lately
      sworn all the surrounding communities to his cause. Having summoned to his
      flag all the Guards discharged by Vitellius,<a name="2fnm111"></a><a
      href="#2fn111" class="2fnnum">111</a> who needed no persuasion to resume
      the war, he was now holding the colony of Forum <a name="2fnm112"></a>Julii,<a
      href="#2fn112" class="2fnnum">112</a> the key to the command of the sea.
      His influence carried the more weight since Forum Julii was his native
      town and, having once been an officer in the Guards, he was respected by
      the men. Besides this, the inhabitants supported their fellow citizen, and
      in the hope of future aggrandizement rendered enthusiastic service to the
      party. When the news of these efficient preparations, somewhat exaggerated
      by rumour, came to the ears of the Vitellians, who were already in some
      doubt, Fabius Valens returned to the ships with four men of the Body
      Guard, three of his friends and three centurions, while Maturus and the
      rest preferred to remain and swear allegiance to Vespasian. As for Valens,
      though he felt safer at sea than among the cities on the coast, he was
      still full of doubts for the future, since he was certain what he had to
      avoid but quite uncertain whom he could trust. Eventually a gale drove him
      upon the <a name="2fnm113"></a>Stoechades,<a href="#2fn113" class="2fnnum">113</a>
      some islands belonging to Marseilles, and there he was overtaken by the
      cruisers which Paulinus had sent in pursuit.

          This was in 45 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, when Caesar was
          carrying on the government with a high hand and small regard for
          precedent. Holding an election on the last day of the year, he was
          told that the consul was dead: there was no one to preside. So he
          promptly announced that Caninius was consul till the next morning. 'So
          no one,' says Cicero, 'breakfasted during his consulship. However,
          there was no crime either, and his vigilance was such that he never

    <h3>
      <a name="The_State" id="The_State"></a>The State of the Provinces
    </h3>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap44" id="IIIchap44"></a><span class="chapnum">44</span>With
      the capture of Valens the tide had now fully turned in favour of
      Vespasian. The movement had been begun in Spain by the First legion <i>Adjutrix</i>,<a
      name="2fnm114"></a><a href="#2fn114" class="2fnnum">114</a> whose
      reverence for Otho's memory made them hate Vitellius. They carried the
      Tenth and the <a name="2fnm115"></a>Sixth<a href="#2fn115" class="2fnnum">115</a>
      with them. The provinces of Gaul soon followed suit. Britain was bound to
      his cause by the favour felt for one who had been sent there by Claudius
      in command of the Second legion, and had fought with great distinction in
      the war. But the adherence of the province was to some extent opposed by
      the other legions, in which many of the centurions and soldiers had been
      promoted by Vitellius. They were used to their emperor and felt some doubt
      about the change. <a name="IIIchap45" id="IIIchap45"></a><span
      class="chapnum">45</span>This quarrel between the legions and the constant
      rumours of civil war, encouraged the Britons to take heart. Their chief
      instigator was one Venutius. He was of a ferocious disposition and hated
      the name of Rome, but his strongest motive was a private quarrel with
      Queen Cartimandua, a member of a powerful family, who ruled the <a
      name="2fnm116"></a>Brigantes.<a href="#2fn116" class="2fnnum">116</a> Her
      authority had lately increased, since she had betrayed King Caratacus into
      the hands of the Romans, and was thus considered to have provided Claudius
      Caesar with material for his <a name="2fnm117"></a>triumph.<a
      href="#2fn117" class="2fnnum">117</a> Thus she had grown rich, and with
      <a name="2page53"></a><span class="pagenum">53</span>prosperity came
      demoralization. She threw over Venutius, who was her husband, and gave her
      hand and kingdom to his squire, Vellocatus. This crime soon proved the
      ruin of her house. The people supported her husband: she defended her
      lover with passionate ferocity. Venutius therefore summoned assistance
      and, aided by the simultaneous revolt of the Brigantes, brought
      Cartimandua into dire straits. She petitioned for troops from Rome. Our
      auxiliaries, both horse and foot, then fought several engagements with
      varying success, but eventually rescued the queen. Thus the kingdom was
      left in the hands of Venutius and the war in ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap46" id="IIIchap46"></a><span class="chapnum">46</span>Almost
      simultaneously a disturbance broke out in Germany, where the inefficiency
      of the generals, the disaffection of the troops, the strength of the
      enemy, and the treachery of our allies all combined to bring the Roman
      government into serious danger. The causes and history of this protracted
      struggle&mdash;for such it proved&mdash;we must leave to a later <a
      name="2fnm118"></a>chapter.<a href="#2fn118" class="2fnnum">118</a>
      Amongst the <a name="2fnm119"></a>Dacians<a href="#2fn119" class="2fnnum">119</a>
      also there was trouble. They could never be trusted, and now that the army
      was moved from Moesia they were no longer under the restraint of fear. At
      first they remained quiet and awaited developments. But when they saw
      Italy in the flames of war, and found the whole empire divided into
      hostile camps, <a name="2page54"></a><span class="pagenum">54</span>they
      fell upon the winter-quarters of the auxiliary infantry and cavalry and
      began to occupy both banks of the Danube. They were on the point of
      storming the Roman camp as well, when Mucianus, who knew of the victory at
      Cremona, sent the Sixth <a name="2fnm120"></a>legion<a href="#2fn120"
      class="2fnnum">120</a> against them. For the empire was in danger of a
      double foreign invasion, if the Dacians and the Germans had broken in from
      opposite directions. But here, as so often, Rome's good fortune saved her
      by bringing Mucianus on the scene with the forces of the East just at the
      moment when we had settled matters at Cremona. Fonteius Agrippa, who had
      for the last year been pro-consul in Asia, was transferred to the
      government of Moesia. His forces were strengthened by a draft from the
      defeated Vitellian army, for in the interest of peace it seemed prudent to
      distribute these troops over the provinces and to keep their hands tied by
      a foreign war.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap47" id="IIIchap47"></a><span class="chapnum">47</span>The
      other peoples soon made their voices heard. <a name="2fnm121"></a>Pontus<a
      href="#2fn121" class="2fnnum">121</a> had suddenly risen in a general
      rebellion at the instigation of a foreign menial, who was in command of
      what had once been the royal fleet. He was one of Polemo's freedmen, by
      name Anicetus, who had formerly been influential and resented the change
      which had converted the kingdom into a province of the Roman empire. He
      accordingly enlisted the <a name="2page55"></a><span class="pagenum">55</span>maritime
      tribes of Pontus in Vitellius' service, attracting all the neediest
      ruffians with promises of plunder. At the head of no mean force he
      suddenly fell upon Trapezus,<a name="2fnm122"></a><a href="#2fn122"
      class="2fnnum">122</a> an ancient and famous city, founded by Greek
      settlers on the frontier of the Pontic kingdom. There he cut to pieces the
      auxiliaries, who had once formed the king's Body Guard, and, after
      receiving the Roman franchise, had adopted our ensigns and equipment,
      while still retaining all the inefficiency and insubordination of Greek
      troops. Anicetus also set fire to the <a name="2fnm123"></a>fleet<a
      href="#2fn123" class="2fnnum">123</a> and thus enjoyed complete mastery of
      the sea, since Mucianus had moved the pick of his cruisers and all his
      troops to Byzantium. The sea was overrun by natives too, who had hurriedly
      built themselves boats. These, which they call 'arks',<a name="2fnm124"></a><a
      href="#2fn124" class="2fnnum">124</a> are broad-bottomed boats with low
      sides, built without any brass or iron rivets. In a rough sea, as the
      waves rise higher and higher, the height of the sides is raised by the
      addition of planks which, in the end, enclose the whole boat under a sort
      of roof. They are thus left to toss up and down on the waves. They have
      bows at both ends and the paddles can be used on either side, since it is
      as easy and as safe to row in one direction as in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap48" id="IIIchap48"></a><span class="chapnum">48</span>This
      state of things attracting Vespasian's attention, he was obliged to send
      out a picked force of detach<a name="2page56"></a><span class="pagenum">56</span>ments
      from the legions under Virdius Geminus, a soldier of tried experience. He
      attacked the enemy while they were dispersed in all directions in quest of
      plunder, and drove them back to their ships. He then had some Liburnian
      cruisers hurriedly constructed and ran Anicetus to ground in the mouth of
      the river <a name="2fnm125"></a>Chobus,<a href="#2fn125" class="2fnnum">125</a>
      where he had taken refuge with the King of the Sedochezi tribe, whose
      alliance he had purchased by bribes. At first, indeed, the king
      endeavoured to protect his petitioner by using threats of violence, but he
      soon saw that it was a choice between making war or being paid for his
      treachery. The barbarian's sense of honour was unequal to this strain. He
      came to terms, surrendered Anicetus and the other fugitives, and thus put
      an end to 'the slaves' war'.
    </p>
    <p>
      This victory delighted Vespasian: everything was succeeding beyond his
      hopes: and to crown all the news of the battle of Cremona now reached him
      in Egypt. He hurried forward all the faster towards Alexandria with the
      object of bringing <a name="2fnm126"></a>starvation<a href="#2fn126"
      class="2fnnum">126</a> upon Vitellius' defeated troops and the inhabitants
      of Rome, who were already feeling the pinch of diminished imports. For he
      was at the same time making preparations for an invasion of the adjacent
      province of <a name="2fnm127"></a>Africa<a href="#2fn127" class="2fnnum">127</a>
      by land and sea. By cutting off their corn supply he hoped to reduce the
      enemy to famine and disunion.

    <h3>
      <a name="Antonius_Advance_Cremona" id="Antonius_Advance_Cremona"></a>Antonius'
      Advance from Cremona
    </h3>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap49" id="IIIchap49"></a><span class="chapnum">49</span>Thus<a
      name="2fnm128"></a><a href="#2fn128" class="2fnnum">128</a> a world-wide
      convulsion marked the passing of the imperial power into new hands.
      Meanwhile, after Cremona, the behaviour of Antonius Primus was not so
      blameless as before. He had settled the war, he felt; the rest would be
      plain sailing. Or, perhaps, in such a nature as his success only brought
      to light his greed and arrogance and all his other dormant vices. While
      harrying Italy like a conquered country, he courted the goodwill of his
      troops and used every word and every action to pave his way to power. He
      allowed his men to appoint centurions themselves in place of those who had
      fallen, and thus gave them a taste for insubordination; for their choice
      fell on the most turbulent spirits. The generals no longer commanded the
      men, but were dragged at the heels of their caprices. This revolutionary
      system, utterly fatal to good discipline, was exploited by Antonius for
      his own profit.<a name="2fnm129"></a><a href="#2fn129" class="2fnnum">129</a>
      Of Mucianus' approach he had no fears, and thus made a mistake even more
      fatal than despising <a name="2fnm130"></a>Vespasian.<a href="#2fn130"
      class="2fnnum">130</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap50" id="IIIchap50"></a><span class="chapnum">50</span>His
      advance, however, continued. As winter was at <a name="2fnm131"></a>hand<a
      href="#2fn131" class="2fnnum">131</a> and the Po had inundated the
      meadows, his column marched unencumbered by heavy baggage.<a name="2page58"></a><span
      class="pagenum">58</span> The main body of the victorious legions was left
      behind at Verona, together with such of the soldiers as were incapacitated
      by wounds or old age, and many besides who were still in good condition.
      Having already broken the back of the campaign, Antonius felt strong
      enough with his auxiliary horse and foot and some picked detachments from
      the legions. The <a name="2fnm132"></a>Eleventh<a href="#2fn132"
      class="2fnnum">132</a> had voluntarily joined the advance. They had held
      back at first, but, seeing Antonius' success, were distressed to think
      they had had no share in it. The column was also accompanied by a force of
      six thousand Dalmatian troops, which had been recently raised. The
      ex-consul, Pompeius <a name="2fnm133"></a>Silvanus,<a href="#2fn133"
      class="2fnnum">133</a> commanded the column, but the actual control was in
      the hands of a general named Annius Bassus. Silvanus was quite ineffective
      as a general, and wasted every chance of action in talking about it.
      Bassus, while showing all due respect, managed him completely, and was
      always ready with quiet efficiency to do anything that had to be done.
      Their force was further increased by enlisting the best of the marines
      from the Ravenna fleet, who were clamouring for service in the legions.
      The vacancies in the fleet were filled by Dalmatians. The army and its
      generals halted at Fanum <a name="2fnm134"></a>Fortunae,<a href="#2fn134"
      class="2fnnum">134</a> still hesitating what policy to adopt, for they had
      heard that the Guards were on the move from Rome, and supposed that the
      Apennines were held by troops. And they had fears of their own. Supplies
      <a name="2page59"></a><span class="pagenum">59</span>were scarce in a
      district devastated by war. The men were mutinous and demanded
      'shoe-money',<a name="2fnm135"></a><a href="#2fn135" class="2fnnum">135</a>
      as they called the donative, with alarming insistence. No provision had
      been made either for money or for stores. The precipitate greed of the
      soldiers made further difficulties, for they each looted what might have
      served for them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap51" id="IIIchap51"></a><span class="chapnum">51</span>I
      find among the best authorities evidence which shows how wickedly careless
      were the victorious army of all considerations of right and wrong. They
      tell how a trooper professed that he had killed his brother in the last
      battle, and demanded a reward from his generals. The dictates of humanity
      forbade them to remunerate such a murder, but in the interests of civil
      war they dared not punish it. They had put him off with the plea that they
      could not at the moment reward his service adequately. And there the story
      stops. However, a similar crime had occurred in earlier civil wars. In the
      battle which Pompeius Strabo fought against Cinna at the Janiculum,<a
      name="2fnm136"></a><a href="#2fn136" class="2fnnum">136</a> one of his
      soldiers killed his own brother and then, realizing what he had done,
      committed suicide. This is recorded by Sisenna.<a name="2fnm137"></a><a
      href="#2fn137" class="2fnnum">137</a> Our ancestors, it seems, had a
      livelier sense than we have both of the glory of good deeds <a

      name="2fnm138"></a>bad.<a href="#2fn138" class="2fnnum">138</a> These and
      other such instances from past history may be appropriately cited,

      and his fellow generals decided to send the cavalry ahead to explore the
      whole of Umbria, and to see whether any of the Apennines were accessible
      by a gentler route; to summon the eagles and <a name="2fnm139"></a>standards<a
      href="#2fn139" class="2fnnum">139</a> and all the troops at <a
      name="2fnm140"></a>Verona,<a href="#2fn140" class="2fnnum">140</a> and to
      fill the Po and the sea with provision ships. Some of the generals
      continually suggested obstacles. Antonius had grown too big for his place,
      and they had surer hopes of reward from Mucianus. He was distressed that
      victory had come so soon, and felt that, if he was not present when Rome
      was taken, he would lose his share in the war and its glory. So he kept on
      writing to Antonius and Varus in ambiguous terms, sometimes urging them to
      'press forward on their path', sometimes expatiating on 'the manifold
      value of delay'. He thus managed to arrange that he could disclaim
      responsibility in case of a reverse, or acknowledge their policy as his
      own if it succeeded. To Plotius Grypus, whom Vespasian had lately raised
      to senatorial rank and put in command of a legion, and to his other trusty
      friends he sent less ambiguous instructions, and they all wrote back
      criticizing the haste with which Antonius and Varus <a name="2page61"></a><span
      class="pagenum">61</span>acted. This was just what Mucianus wanted. He
      forwarded the letters to Vespasian with the result that Antonius' plans
      and exploits were not appreciated as highly as Antonius had hoped. <a
      name="IIIchap53" id="IIIchap53"></a><span class="chapnum">53</span>This he
      took very ill and threw the blame on Mucianus, whose charges he conceived
      had cheapened his exploits. Being little accustomed to control his tongue
      or to obey orders, he was most unguarded in his conversation and composed
      a letter to Vespasian in presumptuous language which ill befitted a
      subject, making various covert charges against Mucianus. 'It was I,' he
      wrote, 'who brought the legions of Pannonia into the field:<a
      name="2fnm141"></a><a href="#2fn141" class="2fnnum">141</a> it was my
      stimulus which stirred up the officers in Moesia:<a name="2fnm142"></a><a
      href="#2fn142" class="2fnnum">142</a> it was by my persistence that we
      broke through the Alps, seized hold of Italy and cut off the German and
      Raetian <a name="2fnm143"></a>auxiliaries.<a href="#2fn143" class="2fnnum">143</a>
      When Vitellius' legions were all scattered and disunited, it was I who
      flung the cavalry on them like a whirlwind, and then pressed home the
      attack with the infantry all day and all night. That victory is my
      greatest achievement and it is entirely my own. As for the mishap at
      Cremona, that was the fault of the war. In old days the civil wars cost
      the country far more damage and involved the destruction of more than one
      town. It is not with couriers and dispatches that I serve my master, but
      with my sword in my hand. Nor can it be said that I have interfered with
      the glory of the men who have meanwhile settled <a name="2page62"></a><span
      class="pagenum">62</span>matters in <a name="2fnm144"></a>Dacia.<a
      href="#2fn144" class="2fnnum">144</a> What peace in Moesia is to them, the
      safety and welfare of Italy are to me. It was my encouragement which
      brought the provinces of Gaul and of Spain, the strongest parts of the
      whole world, over to Vespasian's side. But my labours will prove useless,
      if the reward for the dangers I have run is to fall to the man who was not
      there to share them.' All this reached the ears of Mucianus and a serious
      quarrel resulted. Antonius kept it up in a frank spirit of dislike, while
      Mucianus showed a cunning which was far more implacable.

    <h3>
      <a name="Vitellius_Measures" id="Vitellius_Measures"></a>Vitellius'
      Measures of Defence
    </h3>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap54" id="IIIchap54"></a><span class="chapnum">54</span>After
      the crushing defeat at Cremona Vitellius stupidly suppressed the news of
      the disaster, thus postponing not the danger itself but only his
      precautions against it. Had he admitted the facts and sought advice, hope
      and strength were still left to him: his pretension that all went well
      only made matters worse. He was himself extraordinarily silent about the
      war, and in Rome all discussion of the subject was forbidden. This only
      increased the number of people who, if permitted, would have told the
      truth, but in the face of this prohibition spread grossly exaggerated
      rumours. Nor were the Flavian leaders slow to foster these rumours.
      Whenever they captured Vitellian spies they escorted them round the camp
      to show them the strength of the winning army, and sent them back <a
      name="2page63"></a><span class="pagenum">63</span>again. Vitellius
      cross-examined each of them in private and then had them murdered. A
      centurion named Julius Agrestis, after many interviews, in which he
      endeavoured in vain to fire Vitellius' courage, at last with heroic
      persistence induced the emperor to send him to inspect the enemy's forces
      and discover what had really happened at Cremona. He made no attempt to
      deceive Antonius by concealing the object of his mission, but openly
      avowed the emperor's instructions, stated his intentions and demanded to
      be shown everything. He was given guides, who showed him the field of
      battle, the ruins of Cremona and the captured legions. Back went Agrestis
      to Vitellius. Finding that the emperor disbelieved his report and even
      suggested that he had been bribed, he said, 'You want some certain
      evidence and, since you have no further use for me either alive or dead, I
      will give you evidence that you can believe.' And he was as good as his
      word. He went straight from the emperor's presence and committed suicide.
      Some say he was killed by order of Vitellius, but they give the same
      account of his heroic devotion.<a name="2fnm145"></a><a href="#2fn145"
      class="2fnnum">145</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap55" id="IIIchap55"></a><span class="chapnum">55</span>Vitellius
      was like a man roused from sleep. He dispatched Julius Priscus and Alfenus
      <a name="2fnm146"></a>Varus<a href="#2fn146" class="2fnnum">146</a> with
      fourteen cohorts of Guards and all his available cavalry to hold the
      Apennines. A legion levied from <a name="2page64"></a><span class="pagenum">64</span>the
      <a name="2fnm147"></a>marines<a href="#2fn147" class="2fnnum">147</a> was
      sent after them. This large army of picked men and horses, if there had
      been any general to lead it, was strong enough to have even taken the
      offensive. His other <a name="2fnm148"></a>cohorts<a href="#2fn148"
      class="2fnnum">148</a> were given to his brother, Lucius Vitellius, for
      the protection of the city. The emperor himself gave up none of his
      habitual luxuries, but, feeling nervous and depressed, he hurried on the
      elections and nominated consuls for several years in advance. He lavished
      special <a name="2fnm149"></a>charters<a href="#2fn149" class="2fnnum">149</a>
      on allied communities and extended Latin <a name="2fnm150"></a>rights<a
      href="#2fn150" class="2fnnum">150</a> to foreign towns: he remitted
      taxation here, granted immunities there. In fact, he took no thought for
      the future, and did his best to cripple the empire. However, the mob
      accepted these munificent grants with open mouths. Fools paid money for
      them, but wise men held them invalid, since they could be neither given
      nor received without a revolution. At last he yielded to the demands of
      the army and joined the camp at <a name="2fnm151"></a>Mevania,<a
      href="#2fn151" class="2fnnum">151</a> where they had taken up their
      position. A long train of senators followed him, many moved by their
      ambition, but most by their fears. Here he <a name="2page65"></a><span
      class="pagenum">65</span>was still undecided and at the mercy of
      treacherous advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap56" id="IIIchap56"></a><span class="chapnum">56</span>During
      one of his speeches a portent occurred. A cloud of ill-omened <a
      name="2fnm152"></a>birds<a href="#2fn152" class="2fnnum">152</a> flew over
      his head and its density obscured the daylight. To this was added another
      omen of disaster. A bull broke from the altar, scattered the utensils for
      the ceremony, and escaped so far away that it had to be killed instead of
      being sacrificed according to the proper ritual. But the chief portent was
      Vitellius himself. He was ignorant of soldiering, incapable of
      forethought: knew nothing of drill or scouting, or how far operations
      should be pressed forward or protracted. He always had to ask some one
      else. At every fresh piece of news his expression and gait betrayed his
      alarm. And then he would get drunk. At last he found camp life too
      tedious, and on learning of a mutiny in the fleet at <a name="2fnm153"></a>Misenum<a
      href="#2fn153" class="2fnnum">153</a> he returned to Rome. Every fresh
      blow terrified him, but of the real crisis he seemed insensible. For it
      was open to him to cross the Apennines and with his full strength
      unimpaired to attack the enemy while they were worn out with cold and
      hunger. But by breaking up his forces he sent his keenest soldiers,
      stubbornly loyal to the last, to be killed or taken prisoner. The more
      experienced of his centurions disapproved of this policy and would have
      told him the truth, if they had been consulted. But the emperor's
      intimates refused <a name="2page66"></a><span class="pagenum">66</span>them
      admittance. He had, indeed, formed a habit of regarding wholesome advice
      as unpleasant, and refusing to listen to any that was not agreeable, and
      in the long run fatal.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap57" id="IIIchap57"></a><span class="chapnum">57</span>In
      civil war individual enterprise counts for much. The mutiny of the fleet
      at Misenum had been engineered by Claudius Faventinus, a centurion whom
      Galba had dismissed in disgrace. To obtain his object he had forged a
      letter from Vespasian promising rewards for treachery. The admiral,
      Claudius <a name="2fnm154"></a>Apollinaris,<a href="#2fn154" class="2fnnum">154</a>
      was neither a staunch loyalist nor an enthusiastic traitor. Accordingly
      Apinius Tiro, an ex-praetor, who happened to be at <a name="2fnm155"></a>Minturnae,<a
      href="#2fn155" class="2fnnum">155</a> offered to take the lead of the
      rebels. They proceeded to win over the colonies and country towns. Puteoli
      in particular was strong for Vespasian, while Capua remained loyal to
      Vitellius, for they dragged their local jealousies into the civil war. To
      pacify the excited troops Vitellius chose Claudius Julianus, who had
      lately been in command of the fleet at Misenum and had allowed lax
      discipline. To support him he was given one cohort of the city garrison
      and the force of gladiators already serving under him. The two parties
      encamped close to one another, and it was not long before Julianus came
      over to Vespasian's side. They then joined forces and occupied Tarracina,<a
      name="2fnm156"></a><a href="#2fn156" class="2fnnum">156</a> which owed its
      strength more to <a name="2page67"></a><span class="pagenum">67</span>its
      walls and situation than to the character of its new garrison.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap58" id="IIIchap58"></a><span class="chapnum">58</span>When
      news of this reached Vitellius, he left part of his force at <a
      name="2fnm157"></a>Narnia<a href="#2fn157" class="2fnnum">157</a> with the
      prefects of the <a name="2fnm158"></a>Guard,<a href="#2fn158"
      class="2fnnum">158</a> and sent his brother Lucius with six regiments of
      Guards and five hundred horse to cope with the threatened outbreak in
      Campania. His own nervous depression was somewhat relieved by the
      enthusiasm of the troops and of the populace, who clamoured loudly for
      arms. For he dignified this poor-spirited mob, which would never dare to
      do anything but shout, by the specious titles of 'the army' or 'his
      legions'. His friends were all untrustworthy in proportion to their
      eminence; but on the advice of his freedmen he held a levy for
      conscription and swore in all who gave their names. As their numbers were
      too great, he gave the task of selection to the two consuls. From each of
      the senators he levied a fixed number of slaves and a weight of silver.
      The knights offered money and personal service, while even freedmen
      volunteered similar assistance. Indeed, protestations of loyalty prompted
      by fear, had gradually changed into real sympathy. People began to feel
      pity, not perhaps so much for Vitellius as for the throne and its
      misfortunes. He himself by his looks, his voice, his tears made ceaseless
      demands upon their compassion, promising rewards lavishly and, as men do
      when they are frightened, beyond all limits. He had hitherto <a
      name="2page68"></a><span class="pagenum">68</span>refused the title of
      Caesar,<a name="2fnm159"></a><a href="#2fn159" class="2fnnum">159</a> but
      he now expressed a wish for it. He had a superstitious respect for the
      name, and in moments of terror one listens as much to gossip as to sound
      advice. However, while a rash and ill-conceived undertaking may prosper at
      the outset, in time it always begins to flag. Gradually the senators and
      knights deserted him. At first they hesitated and waited till his back was
      turned, but soon they ceased to care and openly showed their disrespect.
      At last Vitellius grew ashamed of the failure of his efforts and excused
      them from the services which they refused to render.

    <h3>
      <a name="The_Passage" id="The_Passage"></a>The Passage of the Apennines
    </h3>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap59" id="IIIchap59"></a><span class="chapnum">59</span>The
      occupation of <a name="2fnm160"></a>Mevania<a href="#2fn160" class="2fnnum">160</a>
      had terrified Italy with the prospect of a revival of the war, but
      Vitellius' cowardly <a name="2fnm161"></a>retreat<a href="#2fn161"
      class="2fnnum">161</a> sensibly strengthened the popularity of the Flavian
      party. The Samnites, Pelignians, and Marsians were now induced to rise.
      They were jealous of Campania for stealing a march on them, and the change
      of masters, as so often happens, made them perform all their military
      duties with the utmost alacrity. But in crossing the Apennines Antonius'
      army suffered severely from the rough December weather. Though they met
      with no opposition, they found it hard enough to struggle through the
      snow, and realized what danger they would have had to face if Vitellius
      had not happened to turn back. Certainly chance helped the Flavian
      generals quite as often <a name="2page69"></a><span class="pagenum">69</span>as
      their own strategy. Here they came across Petilius Cerialis,<a
      name="2fnm162"></a><a href="#2fn162" class="2fnnum">162</a> who had been
      enabled by his knowledge of the country to elude Vitellius' outposts,
      disguised as a peasant. As he was a near relative of Vespasian and a
      distinguished soldier he was given a place on the staff. Several
      authorities say that Flavius Sabinus and <a name="2fnm163"></a>Domitian<a
      href="#2fn163" class="2fnnum">163</a> were also afforded facilities for
      escape, and that Antonius sent messengers who contrived by various devices
      to get through to them, and made arrangements for an interview and safe
      conduct. Sabinus, however, pleaded that his health was unequal to the
      fatigue of such a bold step. Domitian was quite ready to venture, but
      although the guards to whom Vitellius had entrusted him, promised that
      they would share his flight, he was afraid they might be laying a trap for
      him. As a matter of fact, Vitellius was too anxious for the safety of his
      own relatives to plot any harm against Domitian.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap60" id="IIIchap60"></a><span class="chapnum">60</span>Arrived
      at <a name="2fnm164"></a>Carsulae<a href="#2fn164" class="2fnnum">164</a>
      the Flavian generals took a few days' rest and awaited the arrival of the
      main legionary <a name="2fnm165"></a>force.<a href="#2fn165" class="2fnnum">165</a>
      The place suited them admirably for an encampment. It commanded a wide
      view, and with so many prosperous towns in the rear their supplies were
      safe. The Vitellians too, were only ten miles away, and they had hopes of
      negotiating treason <a name="2page70"></a><span class="pagenum">70</span>with
      them. The soldiers chafed at this delay, preferring victory to peace. They
      did not even want to wait for their own legions, for there would be more
      plunder than danger to share with them. Antonius accordingly summoned a
      meeting of the men and explained to them that Vitellius still had troops
      at his command. Reflection might make them waver, despair would steel
      their hearts. In civil war, he told them, the first steps may be left to
      chance, nothing but careful strategy can win the final victory. The fleet
      at Misenum and the richest districts of Campania had already deserted
      Vitellius, and in the whole world nothing was left to him now except the
      country between Narnia and Tarracina. The battle of Cremona had brought
      them credit enough, and the destruction of the town more than enough
      discredit. Their desire must be not to take Rome but to save it. They
      would gain richer rewards and far more glory if they could show that they
      had saved the senate and people of Rome without shedding a drop of blood.
      Such considerations as these calmed their excitement, and it was not long
      before the legions arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap61" id="IIIchap61"></a><span class="chapnum">61</span>Alarmed
      at the repute of this augmented army, Vitellius' Guards began to waver.
      There was no one to encourage them to fight, while many urged them to
      desert, being eager to hand over their companies or squadrons to the enemy
      and by such a gift to secure the victor's gratitude for the future. These
      also let the Flavians know that the next camp at <a name="2fnm166"></a>Interamna<a
      href="#2fn166" class="2fnnum">166</a><a name="2page71"></a><span
      class="pagenum">71</span> had a garrison of four hundred cavalry. Varus
      was promptly sent off with a light marching force, and the few who offered
      resistance were killed. The majority threw away their arms and begged for
      quarter. Some escaped to the main <a name="2fnm167"></a>camp<a
      href="#2fn167" class="2fnnum">167</a> and spread universal panic by
      exaggerating the strength and prowess of the enemy, in order to mitigate
      the disgrace of losing the fort. In the Vitellian camp all offences went
      unpunished: desertion met with sure reward. Their loyalty soon gave way
      and a competition in treachery began. Tribunes and centurions deserted
      daily, but not the common soldiers, who had grown stubbornly faithful to
      Vitellius. At last, however, Priscus and <a name="2fnm168"></a>Alfenus<a
      href="#2fn168" class="2fnnum">168</a> abandoned the camp and returned to
      Vitellius, thus finally releasing all the others from any obligation to
      blush for their treachery.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap62" id="IIIchap62"></a><span class="chapnum">62</span>About
      the same time Fabius <a name="2fnm169"></a>Valens<a href="#2fn169"
      class="2fnnum">169</a> was executed in his prison at Urbinum, and his head
      was exhibited to Vitellius' Guards to show them that further hope was
      vain. For they cherished a belief that Valens had made his way into
      Germany, and was there mustering his old force and fresh troops as well.
      This evidence of his death threw them into despair. The Flavian army was
      vastly inspirited by it and regarded Valens' death as the end of the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Valens had been born at Anagnia of an equestrian family. He was a man of
      loose morality, not without intellectual gifts, who by indulging in
      frivolity <a name="2page72"></a><span class="pagenum">72</span>posed as a
      wit. In Nero's time he had acted in a harlequinade at the Juvenalian <a
      name="2fnm170"></a>Games.<a href="#2fn170" class="2fnnum">170</a> At first
      he pleaded compulsion, but afterwards he acted voluntarily, and his
      performances were rather clever than respectable. Rising to the command of
      a legion, he supported <a name="2fnm171"></a>Verginius<a href="#2fn171"
      class="2fnnum">171</a> and then defamed his character. He murdered
      Fonteius Capito,<a href="#2fn171" class="2fnnum">171</a> whose loyalty he
      had undermined&mdash;or perhaps because he had failed to do so. He
      betrayed Galba and remained faithful to Vitellius, a merit to which the
      treachery of others served as a foil.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap63" id="IIIchap63"></a><span class="chapnum">63</span>Now
      that their hopes were crushed on all sides, the Vitellians prepared to go
      over to the enemy. But even at this crisis they saved their honour by
      marching down with their standards and colours to the plains below Narnia,
      where the Flavian army was drawn up in full armour ready for battle in two
      deep lines on either side of the road. The Vitellians marched in between
      and were surrounded. Antonius then spoke to them kindly and told them to
      remain, some at Narnia and some at Interamna. He also left behind some of
      the victorious legions, which were strong enough to quell any outbreak but
      would not molest them so long as they remained quiet.

    <h3>
      <a name="The_Abdication" id="The_Abdication"></a>The Abdication of
      Vitellius and the Burning of the Capitol
    </h3>
    <p>
      During these days Antonius and Varus kept sending messages to Vitellius,
      in which they offered him his life, a gift of money, and the choice of a
      safe retreat in Campania, if he would stop the war and surrender himself
      and his children to Vespasian. Mucianus wrote him letters to the same
      effect. Vitellius usually took these offers seriously and talked about the
      number of slaves he would have and the choice of a seaside place. He had
      sunk, indeed, into such mental torpor that, if other people had not
      remembered that he was an emperor, he was certainly beginning to forget it
      himself. <a name="IIIchap64" id="IIIchap64"></a><span class="chapnum">64</span>However,
      it was to Flavius Sabinus, the City Prefect, that the leading men at Rome
      addressed themselves. They urged him secretly not to lose all share in the
      glory of victory. They pointed out that the City Garrison was under his
      own command, and that he could count on the police and their own bands of
      slaves, to say nothing of the good fortune of the party and all the
      advantage that victory gives. He must not leave all the glory to Antonius
      and Varus. Vitellius had nothing left but a few regiments of guards, who
      were seriously alarmed at the bad news which came from every quarter. As
      for the populace, their feelings soon changed, and if he put himself at
      their head, they would be just as loud in their flattery of Vespasian.
      Vitellius himself could not even cope <a name="2page74"></a><span
      class="pagenum">74</span>with success, and disaster had positively
      paralysed him. The credit of ending the war would go to the man who seized
      the city. It was eminently fitting that Sabinus should secure the throne
      for his brother, and that Vespasian should hold him higher than any one
      else.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap65" id="IIIchap65"></a><span class="chapnum">65</span>Age
      had enfeebled Sabinus, and he showed no alacrity to listen to such talk as
      this. Some people covertly insinuated that he was jealous of his brother's
      success and was trying to delay its realization. Flavius Sabinus was the
      elder brother and, while they were both private persons, he had been the
      richer and more influential. It was also believed that he had been chary
      in helping Vespasian to recover his financial position, and had taken a
      mortgage on his house and estates. Consequently, though they remained
      openly friendly, there were suspicions of a secret enmity between them.
      The more charitable explanation is that Sabinus's gentle nature shrank
      from the idea of bloodshed and massacre, and that this was his reason for
      so constantly discussing with Vitellius the prospects of peace and a
      capitulation on terms. After several interviews at his house they finally
      came to a settlement&mdash;so the report went&mdash;at the Temple of <a
      name="2fnm172"></a>Apollo.<a href="#2fn172" class="2fnnum">172</a> To the
      actual conversation there were only two witnesses, Cluvius <a
      name="2fnm173"></a>Rufus<a href="#2fn173" class="2fnnum">173</a> and
      Silius <a name="2fnm174"></a>Italicus,<a href="#2fn174" class="2fnnum">174</a>
      but the expression of their faces was watched from a distance.<a
      name="2page75"></a><span class="pagenum">75</span> Vitellius was said to
      look abject and demoralized: Sabinus showed less sign of pride than of
      pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap66" id="IIIchap66"></a><span class="chapnum">66</span>Had
      Vitellius found it no harder to persuade his friends than to make his own
      renunciation, Vespasian's army might have marched into Rome without
      bloodshed. But as it was, each of his friends in proportion to his loyalty
      persisted in refusing terms of peace. They pointed to the danger and
      disgrace. Would their conqueror keep his promises any longer than he
      liked? However great Vespasian's self-confidence, he could not allow
      Vitellius to live in private. Nor would the losers acquiesce: their very
      pity would be a menace.<a name="2fnm175"></a><a href="#2fn175"
      class="2fnnum">175</a> 'Of course,' they said, 'you are an old man. You
      have done with fortune, good or bad. But what sort of repute or position
      would your son <a name="2fnm176"></a>Germanicus<a href="#2fn176"
      class="2fnnum">176</a> enjoy? At present they are promising you money and
      a household, and the pleasant shores of Campania. But when once Vespasian
      has seized the throne, neither he nor his friends nor even his army will
      feel their safety assured until the rival claimant is dead. They
      imprisoned Fabius Valens and meant to make use of him if a crisis
      occurred, but they found him too great an incubus. You may be sure that
      Antonius and Fuscus and that typical representative of the party,
      Mucianus, will have no choice but to kill you. Julius Caesar did not let
      Pompey live unmolested, nor Augustus <a name="2fnm177"></a>Antony.<a
      href="#2fn177" class="2fnnum">177</a><a name="2page76"></a><span
      class="pagenum">76</span> Do you suppose that Vespasian's is a loftier
      disposition? Why, he was one of your father's dependants,<a name="2fnm178"></a><a
      href="#2fn178" class="2fnnum">178</a> when your father was Claudius's <a
      name="2fnm179"></a>colleague.<a href="#2fn179" class="2fnnum">179</a> No,
      think of your father's censorship, his three consulships,<a href="#2fn179"
      class="2fnnum">179</a> and all the honour your great house has won. You
      must not disgrace them. Despair, at least, should nerve your courage. The
      troops are steadfast; you still enjoy the people's favour. Indeed, nothing
      worse can happen to you than what we are eager to face of our own free
      will. If we are defeated, we must die; if we surrender, we must die. All
      that matters is whether we breathe our last amid mockery and insult or
      bravely and with honour.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap67" id="IIIchap67"></a><span class="chapnum">67</span>But
      Vitellius was deaf to all courageous counsel. His mind was obsessed with
      pity for his wife and children, and an anxious fear that obstinate
      resistance might make the conqueror merciless towards them. He had also a
      <a name="2fnm180"></a>mother,<a href="#2fn180" class="2fnnum">180</a> very
      old and infirm, but she had opportunely died a few days before and thus
      forestalled the ruin of her house. All she had got out of her son's
      principate was sorrow and a good name. On December 17 he heard the news
      that the legion and the Guards at Narnia had deserted him and surrendered
      to the enemy. He at once put on mourning and left the palace, surrounded
      by his sorrowful household. His small son was carried in a little litter,
      as though this had been his funeral. The populace <a name="2page77"></a><span
      class="pagenum">77</span>uttered untimely flatteries: the soldiers kept an
      ominous silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap68" id="IIIchap68"></a><span class="chapnum">68</span>On
      that day there was no one so indifferent to the tragedy of human life as
      to be unmoved by this spectacle. A Roman emperor, yesterday master of the
      inhabited world, had left the seat of his authority, and was now passing
      through the streets of the city, through the crowding populace, quitting
      the throne. Such a sight had never been seen or heard of before. The
      dictator, Caesar, had been the victim of sudden violence; Caligula of a
      secret conspiracy. Nero's had been a stealthy flight to some obscure
      country house under cover of night. Piso and Galba might almost be said to
      have fallen on the field of battle. But here was Vitellius&mdash;before
      the assembly of his own people, his own soldiers around him, with women
      even looking on&mdash;uttering a few sentences suitable to his miserable
      situation. He said it was in the interest of peace and of his country that
      he now resigned. He begged them only to retain his memory in their hearts
      and to take pity on his brother, his wife, and his little innocent
      children. As he said this, he held out his son to them and commended him,
      now to individuals, now to the whole assembly. At last tears choked his
      voice. Turning to the consul, Caecilius <a name="2fnm181"></a>Simplex,<a
      href="#2fn181" class="2fnnum">181</a> who was standing by, he unstrapped
      his sword and offered to surrender it as a symbol of his power over the
      life and death of his subjects. The consul refused. The people in the
      assembly shouted 'No'. So he left them with the <a name="2page78"></a><span
      class="pagenum">78</span>intention of depositing the regalia in the Temple
      of Concord and then going to his brother's house. But he was faced with a
      still louder uproar. They refused to let him enter a private house, and
      shouted to him to return to the palace. They blocked every other way and
      only left the road leading into the Via Sacra <a name="2fnm182"></a>open.<a
      href="#2fn182" class="2fnnum">182</a> Not knowing what else to do,
      Vitellius returned to the palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap69" id="IIIchap69"></a><span class="chapnum">69</span>A
      rumour of his abdication had preceded him, and Flavius Sabinus had sent
      written instructions to the Guards'<a name="2fnm183"></a><a href="#2fn183"
      class="2fnnum">183</a> officers to keep the men in hand. Thus the whole
      empire seemed to have fallen into Vespasian's lap. The chief senators, the
      majority of the knights, and the whole of the city garrison and the police
      came flocking to the house of Flavius Sabinus. There they heard the news
      of the popular enthusiasm for Vitellius and the threatening attitude of
      the German <a name="2fnm184"></a>Guards.<a href="#2fn184" class="2fnnum">184</a>
      But Sabinus had gone too far to draw back, and when he showed hesitation,
      they all began to urge him to fight, each being afraid for his own safety
      if the Vitellians were to fall on them when they were disunited and
      consequently weaker. However, as so often happens on these occasions,
      every one offered to give <a name="2page79"></a><span class="pagenum">79</span>advice
      but few to share the danger. While Sabinus' Body Guard were marching down
      by the Fundane <a name="2fnm185"></a>reservoir<a href="#2fn185"
      class="2fnnum">185</a> they were attacked by some of the most determined
      Vitellians. The surprise was unpremeditated, but the Vitellians got the
      best of an unimportant skirmish. In the panic Sabinus chose what was at
      the moment the safest course, and occupied the summit of the <a
      name="2fnm186"></a>Capitol,<a href="#2fn186" class="2fnnum">186</a> where
      his troops were joined by a few senators and knights. It is not easy to
      record their names, since after Vespasian's victory crowds of people
      claimed credit for this service to the party. There were even some women
      who endured the siege, the most famous of them being Verulana Gratilla,
      who had neither children nor relatives to attract her, but only her love
      of <a name="2fnm187"></a>danger.<a href="#2fn187" class="2fnnum">187</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Vitellians, who were investing them, kept a half-hearted watch, and
      Sabinus was thus enabled to send for his own children and his nephew
      Domitian at dead of night, dispatching a courier by an unguarded route to
      tell the Flavian generals that he and his men were under siege, and would
      be in great straits unless they were rescued. All night, indeed, he was
      quite unmolested, and could have escaped with perfect safety. The
      Vitellian troops could face danger with spirit, but were much too careless
      in the task of keeping guard; <a name="2page80"></a><span class="pagenum">80</span>besides
      which a sudden storm of chilly rain interfered with their sight and
      hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap70" id="IIIchap70"></a><span class="chapnum">70</span>At
      daybreak, before the two sides commenced hostilities, Sabinus sent
      Cornelius Martialis, who had been a senior centurion, to Vitellius with
      instructions to complain that the conditions were being violated; that he
      had evidently made a mere empty show of abdication, meant to deceive a
      number of eminent gentlemen. Else why had he gone from the meeting to his
      brother's house, which caught the eye from a conspicuous position
      overlooking the Forum, and not rather to his wife's on the Aventine. That
      was the proper course for a private citizen, anxious to avoid all
      pretension to supreme authority. But no, Vitellius had returned to the
      palace, the very stronghold of imperial majesty. From there he had
      launched a column of armed men, who had strewn with innocent dead the most
      crowded quarter of Rome, and even laid violent hands upon the Capitol. As
      for Sabinus himself, the messenger was to say, he was only a civilian, a
      mere member of the senate. While the issue was being decided between
      Vespasian and Vitellius by the engagement of legions, the capture of
      towns, the capitulation of cohorts; even when the provinces of Spain, of
      Germany, of Britain, had risen in revolt; he, though Vespasian's brother,
      had still remained faithful to his allegiance, until Vitellius, unasked,
      began to invite him to a conference. Peace and union, he was to remind
      him, serve the interest of the losers, and only the reputation of the
      winners. If Vitellius <a name="2page81"></a><span class="pagenum">81</span>regretted
      their compact, he ought not to take arms against Sabinus, whom he had
      treacherously deceived, and against Vespasian's son, who was still a mere
      boy. What was the good of killing one youth and one old man? He ought
      rather to march out against the legions and fight for the empire on the
      field. The result of the battle would decide all other questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Greatly alarmed, Vitellius replied with a few words in which he tried to
      excuse himself and throw the blame on his soldiers. 'I am too unassuming,'
      he said, 'to cope with their overpowering impatience.' He then warned
      Martialis to make his way out of the house by a secret passage, for fear
      that the soldiers should kill him as an ambassador of the peace to which
      they were so hostile. Vitellius himself was not in a position to issue
      orders or prohibitions; no longer an emperor, merely an excuse for war.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap71" id="IIIchap71"></a><span class="chapnum">71</span>Martialis
      had hardly returned to the Capitol when the furious soldiery arrived. They
      had no general to lead them: each was a law to himself. Their column
      marched at full speed through the Forum and past the temples overlooking
      it. Then in battle order they advanced up the steep hill in front of them,
      until they reached the lowest gates of the fortress on the Capitol. In old
      days there was a series of colonnades at the side of this slope, on the
      right as you go up. Emerging on to the roof of these, the besieged
      overwhelmed the Vitellians with showers of stones and tiles. The attacking
      party carried nothing but swords, and it seemed a long business to send
      for siege-engines and <a name="2page82"></a><span class="pagenum">82</span>missiles.
      So they flung torches into the <a name="2fnm188"></a>nearest<a
      href="#2fn188" class="2fnnum">188</a> colonnade and, following in the wake
      of the flames, would have burst through the burnt gates of the Capitol, if
      Sabinus had not torn down all the available statues&mdash;the monuments of
      our ancestors' glory&mdash;and built a sort of barricade on the very
      threshold. They then tried to attack the Capitol by two opposite
      approaches, one near the 'Grove of Refuge'<a name="2fnm189"></a><a
      href="#2fn189" class="2fnnum">189</a> and the other by the hundred steps
      which lead up to the Tarpeian Rock. This double assault came as a
      surprise. That by the Refuge was the closer and more vigorous. Nothing
      could stop the Vitellians, who climbed up by some contiguous houses built
      on to the side of the hill, which in the days of prolonged peace had been
      raised to such a height that their roofs were level with the floor of the
      Capitol. It is uncertain whether the buildings at this point were fired by
      the assailants or&mdash;as tradition prefers&mdash;by the besieged in
      trying to dislodge their enemies who had struggled up so far. The fire
      spread to the colonnades adjoining the temples, and then the 'eagles'<a
      name="2fnm190"></a><a href="#2fn190" class="2fnnum">190</a> supporting the
      roof, which were made of very old wood, caught the flames and fed them.
      And so the Capitol, with its doors fast shut, undefended and unplundered,
      was burnt to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap72" id="IIIchap72"></a><span class="chapnum">72</span>Since
      the foundation of the city no such deplorable and horrible disaster had
      ever befallen the people of<a name="2page83"></a><span class="pagenum">83</span>
      Rome. It was no case of foreign invasion. Had our own wickedness allowed,
      the country might have been enjoying the blessings of a benign Providence;
      and yet here was the seat of Jupiter Almighty&mdash;the temple solemnly
      founded by our ancestors as the pledge of their imperial greatness, on
      which not even <a name="2fnm191"></a>Porsenna,<a href="#2fn191"
      class="2fnnum">191</a> when Rome surrendered, nor the Gauls, when they
      took it, had ever dared to lay rash hands&mdash;being brought utterly to
      ruin by the mad folly of two rival emperors!<a name="2fnm192"></a><a
      href="#2fn192" class="2fnnum">192</a> The Capitol had been burnt before in
      civil war,<a name="2fnm193"></a><a href="#2fn193" class="2fnnum">193</a>
      but that was the crime of private persons. Now it had been openly
      assaulted by the people of Rome and openly burnt by them. And what was the
      cause of war? what the recompense for such a disaster? Were we fighting
      for our country?
    </p>
    <p>
      King Tarquinius Priscus had vowed to build this temple in the Sabine war,
      and had laid the foundations on a scale that suited rather his hope of the
      city's future greatness than the still moderate fortunes of the Roman
      people. Later Servius Tullius, with the aid of Rome's allies, and
      Tarquinius Superbus, with the spoils of the Volscians after the capture of
      Suessa <a name="2fnm194"></a>Pometia,<a href="#2fn194" class="2fnnum">194</a>
      continued the building. But the glory of completing it was reserved for
      the days of freedom. After the expulsion of the kings, Horatius Pulvillus,
      <a name="2page84"></a><span class="pagenum">84</span>in his second <a
      name="2fnm195"></a>consulship<a href="#2fn195" class="2fnnum">195</a>
      dedicated this monument on such a magnificent scale, that in later days,
      with all her boundless wealth, Rome has been able to embellish but never
      to enlarge it. After an interval of four hundred and fifteen years, in the
      consulship of Lucius Scipio and Caius <a name="2fnm196"></a>Norbanus,<a
      href="#2fn196" class="2fnnum">196</a> it was burnt and rebuilt on the same
      site. Sulla after his victory undertook the task of restoring it, but did
      not dedicate it. This only was lacking to justify his title of 'Fortune's
      Favourite'.<a name="2fnm197"></a><a href="#2fn197" class="2fnnum">197</a>
      Much as the emperors did to it, the name of Lutatius <a name="2fnm198"></a>Catulus<a
      href="#2fn198" class="2fnnum">198</a> still remained upon it up to the
      time of Vitellius.<a name="2fnm199"></a><a href="#2fn199" class="2fnnum">199</a>
      This was the temple that was now ablaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap73" id="IIIchap73"></a><span class="chapnum">73</span>The
      besieged suffered more panic than their assailants. The Vitellian soldiers
      lacked neither resource nor steadiness in moments of crisis. But on the
      other side the troops were terrified, the <a name="2fnm200"></a>general<a
      href="#2fn200" class="2fnnum">200</a> inert, and apparently so paralysed
      that he was practically deaf and dumb. He neither adopted others' plans
      nor formed any of his own, but only drifted about from place to place,
      attracted by the shouts of the enemy, contradicting all his own orders.
      The result was what always happens in a hopeless disaster: everybody gave
      orders and nobody obeyed them. At last they threw away their weapons and
      began to peer round for <a name="2page85"></a><span class="pagenum">85</span>a
      way of escape or some means of hiding. Then the Vitellians came bursting
      in, and with fire and sword made one red havoc. A few good soldiers dared
      to show fight and were cut to pieces. Of these the most notable were
      Cornelius <a name="2fnm201"></a>Martialis,<a href="#2fn201" class="2fnnum">201</a>
      Aemilius <a name="2fnm202"></a>Pacensis,<a href="#2fn202" class="2fnnum">202</a>
      Casperius Niger, and Didius Scaeva. Flavius Sabinus, who stood unarmed and
      making no attempt to escape, was surrounded together with the consul
      Quintius Atticus,<a name="2fnm203"></a><a href="#2fn203" class="2fnnum">203</a>
      whose empty title made him a marked man, as well as his personal vanity,
      which had led him to distribute manifestoes full of compliments to
      Vespasian and insults against Vitellius. The rest escaped by various
      means. Some disguised themselves as slaves: some were sheltered by
      faithful dependants: some hid among the baggage. Others again caught the
      Vitellians' password, by which they recognized each other, and actually
      went about demanding it and giving it when challenged, thus escaping under
      a cloak of effrontery.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap74" id="IIIchap74"></a><span class="chapnum">74</span>When
      the enemy first broke in, Domitian had taken refuge with the sacristan,
      and was enabled by the ingenuity of a freedman to escape among a crowd of
      worshippers in a linen <a name="2fnm204"></a>dress,<a href="#2fn204"
      class="2fnnum">204</a> and to take refuge near the Velabrum with Cornelius
      Primus, one of his father's dependants. When his father came to the
      throne, Domitian pulled down the sacristan's lodging and <a name="2page86"></a><span
      class="pagenum">86</span>built a little chapel to Jupiter the Saviour with
      an altar, on which his adventures were depicted in marble relief. Later,
      when he became emperor, he dedicated a huge temple to Jupiter the Guardian
      with a statue of himself in the lap of the god.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sabinus and Atticus were loaded with chains and taken to Vitellius, who
      received them without any language or looks of disfavour, much to the
      chagrin of those who wanted to see them punished with death and themselves
      rewarded for their successful labours. When those who stood nearest
      started an outcry, the dregs of the populace soon began to demand Sabinus'
      execution with mingled threats and flatteries. Vitellius came out on to
      the steps of the palace prepared to plead for him: but they forced him to
      desist. Sabinus was stabbed and riddled with wounds: his head was cut off
      and the trunk dragged away to the Ladder <a name="IIIchap75" id="IIIchap75"></a><span
      class="chapnum">75</span>of <a name="2fnm205"></a>Sighs.<a href="#2fn205"
      class="2fnnum">205</a> Such was the end of a man who certainly merits no
      contempt. He had served his country for thirty-five years, and won credit
      both as civilian and soldier. His integrity and fairness were beyond
      criticism. He talked too much about himself, but this is the one charge
      which rumour could hint against him in the seven years when he was
      Governor of Moesia, and the twelve years during which he was Prefect of
      the City. At the end of his life some thought he showed a lack of
      enterprise, but many believed him <a name="2page87"></a><span
      class="pagenum">87</span>a moderate man, who was anxious to save his
      fellow citizens from bloodshed. In this, at any rate, all would agree,
      that before Vespasian became emperor the reputation of his house rested on
      Sabinus. It is said that Mucianus was delighted to hear of his murder, and
      many people maintained that it served the interests of peace by putting an
      end to the jealousy of two rivals, one of whom was the emperor's brother,
      while the other posed as his partner in the <a name="2fnm206"></a>empire.<a
      href="#2fn206" class="2fnnum">206</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      When the people further demanded the execution of the consul, Vitellius
      withstood them. He had forgiven Atticus, and felt that he owed him a
      favour, for, when asked who had set fire to the Capitol, Atticus had taken
      the blame on himself, by which avowal&mdash;or was it a well-timed
      falsehood?&mdash;he had fixed all the guilt and odium on himself and
      exonerated the Vitellian party.

    </h3>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap76" id="IIIchap76"></a><span class="chapnum">76</span>About
      this same time Lucius <a name="2fnm207"></a>Vitellius,<a href="#2fn207"
      class="2fnnum">207</a> who had pitched his camp at the Temple of <a
      name="2fnm208"></a>Feronia,<a href="#2fn208" class="2fnnum">208</a> made
      every effort to destroy Tarracina, where he had shut up the gladiators and
      sailors, who would not venture to leave the shelter of the walls or to
      face death in the open. The gladiators were commanded, as we have already
      seen,<a name="2fnm209"></a><a href="#2fn209" class="2fnnum">209</a> by
      Julianus, and the sailors by<a name="2page88"></a><span class="pagenum">88</span>
      Apollinaris, men whose dissolute inefficiency better suited gladiators
      than general officers. They set no watch, and made no attempt to repair
      the weak places in the walls. Day and night they idled loosely; the
      soldiers were dispatched in all directions to find them luxuries; that
      beautiful coast rang with their revelry; and they only spoke of war in
      their cups. A few days earlier, Apinius <a name="2fnm210"></a>Tiro<a
      href="#2fn210" class="2fnnum">210</a> had started on his mission, and, by
      rigorously requisitioning gifts of money in all the country towns, was
      winning more unpopularity than assistance for the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap77" id="IIIchap77"></a><span class="chapnum">77</span>In
      the meantime, one of Vergilius Capito's slaves deserted to Lucius
      Vitellius, and promised that, if he were provided with men, he would put
      the abandoned castle into their hands. Accordingly, at dead of night he
      established a few lightly armed cohorts on the top of the hills which
      overlooked the enemy. Thence the soldiers came charging down more to
      butchery than battle. They cut down their victims standing helpless and
      unarmed or hunting for their weapons, or perhaps newly startled from their
      sleep&mdash;all in a bewildering confusion of darkness, panic,
      bugle-calls, and savage cries. A few of the gladiators resisted and sold
      their lives dearly. The rest rushed to the ships; and there the same panic
      and confusion reigned, for the villagers were all mixed up with the
      troops, and the Vitellians slaughtered them too, without distinction. Just
      as the <a name="2page89"></a><span class="pagenum">89</span>first uproar
      began, six Liburnian cruisers slipped away with the admiral Apollinaris on
      board. The rest were either captured on the beach or overweighted and sunk
      by the crowds that clambered over them. Julianus was taken to Lucius
      Vitellius, who had him flogged till he bled and then killed before his
      eyes. Some writers have accused Lucius Vitellius' wife, <a name="2fnm211"></a>Triaria,<a
      href="#2fn211" class="2fnnum">211</a> of putting on a soldier's sword, and
      with insolent cruelty showing herself among the horrors of the captured
      town. Lucius himself sent a laurel-wreath to his brother in token of his
      success, and inquired whether he wished him to return at once or to
      continue reducing Campania. This delay saved not only Vespasian's party
      but Rome as well. Had he marched on the city while his men were fresh from
      their victory, with the flush of success added to their natural
      intrepidity, there would have been a tremendous struggle, which must have
      involved the city's destruction. Lucius Vitellius, too, for all his evil
      repute, was a man of action. Good men owe their power to their virtues;
      but he was one of that worst sort whose vices are their only virtue.

      <a name="The_Sack" id="The_Sack"></a>The Sack of Rome and the end of
      Vitellius
    </h3>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap78" id="IIIchap78"></a><span class="chapnum">78</span>While
      <a name="2fnm212"></a>things<a href="#2fn212" class="2fnnum">212</a> went
      thus on Vitellius' side, the Flavian army after leaving Narnia spent the
      days of <a name="2page90"></a><span class="pagenum">90</span>the
      Saturnalian <a name="2fnm213"></a>holiday<a href="#2fn213" class="2fnnum">213</a>
      quietly at <a name="2fnm214"></a>Ocriculum.<a href="#2fn214" class="2fnnum">214</a>
      The object of this disastrous delay was to wait for Mucianus. Antonius has
      been suspected of delaying treacherously after receiving a secret
      communication from Vitellius, offering him as the price of treason the
      consulship, his young daughter, and a rich dowry. Others hold that this
      story was invented to gratify Mucianus. Many consider that the policy of
      all the Flavian generals was rather to threaten the city than to attack
      it. They realized that Vitellius had lost the best cohorts of his Guards,
      and now that all his forces were cut off they expected he would abdicate.
      But this prospect was spoilt first by Sabinus' precipitation and then by
      his cowardice, for, after very rashly taking arms, he failed to defend
      against three cohorts of Guards the strongly fortified castle on the
      Capitol, which ought to have been impregnable even to a large army.
      However, it is not easy to assign to any one man the blame which they all
      share. Even Mucianus helped to delay the victors' advance by the ambiguity
      of his dispatches, and Antonius was also to blame for his untimely
      compliance with instructions&mdash;or else for trying to throw the <a
      name="2fnm215"></a>responsibility<a href="#2fn215" class="2fnnum">215</a>
      on Mucianus. The other generals thought the war was over, and thus
      rendered its final scene all the more appalling. Petilius Cerialis was
      sent forward with a thousand cavalry to <a name="2page91"></a><span
      class="pagenum">91</span>make his way by cross-roads through the Sabine
      country, and enter the city by the Salarian <a name="2fnm216"></a>road.<a
      href="#2fn216" class="2fnnum">216</a> But even he failed to make
      sufficient haste, and at last the news of the siege of the Capitol brought
      them all at once to their senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap79" id="IIIchap79"></a><span class="chapnum">79</span>Marching
      up the Flaminian road, it was already deep night when Antonius reached
      'The Red Rocks'.<a name="2fnm217"></a><a href="#2fn217" class="2fnnum">217</a>
      His help had come too late. There he heard that Sabinus had been killed,
      and the Capitol burnt; the city was in panic; everything looked black;
      even the populace and the slaves were arming for Vitellius. Petilius
      Cerialis, too, had been defeated in a cavalry engagement. He had pushed on
      without caution, thinking the enemy already beaten, and the Vitellians
      with a mixed force of horse and foot had caught him unawares. The
      engagement had taken place near the city among farm buildings and gardens
      and winding lanes, with which the Vitellians were familiar, while the
      Flavians were terrified by their ignorance. Besides, the troopers were not
      all of one mind; some of them belonged to the force which had recently
      surrendered at Narnia, and were waiting to see which side won. Julius
      Flavianus, who commanded a regiment of cavalry, was taken prisoner. The
      rest fell into a disgraceful panic and fled, but the pursuit was not
      continued beyond Fidenae.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap80" id="IIIchap80"></a><span class="chapnum">80</span>This
      success served to increase the popular excitement. The city rabble now
      took arms. A few had service-shields: most of them snatched up any weapons
      <a name="2page92"></a><span class="pagenum">92</span>they could find and
      clamoured to be given the sign for battle. Vitellius expressed his
      gratitude to them and bade them sally forth to protect the city. He then
      summoned a meeting of the senate, at which envoys were appointed to go to
      the two armies and urge them in the name of public welfare to accept
      peace. The fortunes of the envoys varied. Those who approached Petilius
      Cerialis found themselves in dire danger, for the soldiers indignantly
      refused their terms. The praetor, Arulenus Rusticus,<a name="2fnm218"></a><a
      href="#2fn218" class="2fnnum">218</a> was wounded. Apart from the wrong
      done to a praetor and an envoy, the man's own acknowledged worth made this
      seem all the more scandalous. His companions were flogged, and the lictor
      nearest to him was killed for venturing to make a way through the crowd.
      Indeed, if the guard provided by the general had not intervened, a Roman
      envoy, the sanctity of whose person even foreign nations respect, might
      have been wickedly murdered in the mad rage of civil strife under the very
      walls of Rome. Those who went to Antonius met with a more reasonable
      reception; not that the soldiers were less violent, but the general had
      more authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap81" id="IIIchap81"></a><span class="chapnum">81</span>A
      knight named Musonius Rufus had attached himself to the envoys. He was a
      student of philosophy and an enthusiastic advocate of Stoicism. He mingled
      with the armed soldiers offering them advice and discoursing on the
      advantages of peace and the perils of war. This amused many of them and
      bored still <a name="2page93"></a><span class="pagenum">93</span>more.
      Some, indeed, wanted to maul him and kick him out, but the advice of the
      more sober spirits and the threats of others persuaded him to cut short
      his ill-timed lecture. The Vestal Virgins, too, came in procession to
      bring Antonius a letter from Vitellius, in which he demanded one day's
      postponement of the final crisis, saying that everything could easily be
      settled, if only they would grant this respite. Antonius sent the Virgins
      away with all respect, and wrote in answer to Vitellius that the murder of
      Sabinus and the burning of the Capitol had broken off all negotiations.
      <a name="IIIchap82" id="IIIchap82"></a><span class="chapnum">82</span>However,
      he summoned the legions to a meeting and endeavoured to mollify them,
      proposing that they should pitch their camp near the Mulvian Bridge and
      enter the city on the following day. His motive for delay was a fear that
      the troops, when once their blood was up after a skirmish, would have no
      respect for civilians or senators, or even for the temples and shrines of
      the gods. But they suspected every postponement as a hindrance to their
      victory. Moreover, some colours which were seen glittering along the
      hills, gave the impression of a hostile force, although none but peaceful
      citizens accompanied them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attack was made in three columns. One advanced from its original
      position on the Flaminian road, one kept near the bank of the Tiber, and
      the third approached the Colline Gate along the Salarian road. The cavalry
      rode into the mob and scattered them. But the Vitellian troops faced the
      enemy, themselves, too, in three separate divisions. Again <a
      name="2page94"></a><span class="pagenum">94</span>and again they engaged
      before the walls with varying success. But the Flavians had the advantage
      of being well led and thus more often won success. Only one of the
      attacking parties suffered at all severely, that which had made its way
      along narrow, greasy lanes to Sallust's <a name="2fnm219"></a>Gardens<a
      href="#2fn219" class="2fnnum">219</a> on the left side of the city.
      Standing on the garden walls, the Vitellians hurled stones and javelins
      down upon them and held them back until late in the day. But at last the
      cavalry forced an entrance by the Colline Gate and took the defenders in
      the rear. Then the opposing forces met on the Martian Plain itself.
      Fortune favoured the Flavians and the sense of victories won. The
      Vitellians charged in sheer despair, but, though driven back, they
      gathered again in the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap83" id="IIIchap83"></a><span class="chapnum">83</span>The
      people came and watched the fighting, cheering and applauding now one
      side, now the other, like spectators at a gladiatorial contest. Whenever
      one side gave ground, and the soldiers began to hide in shops or seek
      refuge in some private house, they clamoured for them to be dragged out
      and killed, and thus got the greater part of the plunder for themselves:
      for while the soldiers were busy with the bloody work of massacre, the
      spoil fell to the crowd. The scene throughout the city was hideous and
      terrible: on the one side fighting and wounded men, on the other baths and
      restaurants: here lay heaps of bleeding dead, and close at hand were
      harlots and their companions&mdash;all the vice and licence of luxurious
      peace, <a name="2page95"></a><span class="pagenum">95</span>and all the
      crime and horror of a captured town. One might well have thought the city
      mad with fury and mad with pleasure at the same time. Armies had fought in
      the city before this, twice when Sulla mastered <a name="2fnm220"></a>Rome,<a
      href="#2fn220" class="2fnnum">220</a> once under <a name="2fnm221"></a>Cinna.<a
      href="#2fn221" class="2fnnum">221</a> Nor were there less horrors then.
      What was now so inhuman was the people's indifference. Not for one minute
      did they interrupt the life of pleasure. The fighting was a new amusement

      Caring nothing for either party, they enjoyed themselves in riotous
      dissipation and took a frank pleasure in their country's disaster.

    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap84" id="IIIchap84"></a><span class="chapnum">84</span>The
      storming of the Guards' camp was the most troublesome task. It was still
      held by some of the bravest as a forlorn hope, which made the victors all
      the more eager to take it, especially those who had originally served in
      the Guards. They employed against it every means ever devised for the
      storming of the most strongly fortified towns, a 'tortoise',<a
      name="2fnm223"></a><a href="#2fn223" class="2fnnum">223</a> artillery,
      earthworks, firebrands. This, they cried, was the crown of all the toil
      and danger they had undergone in all their battles. They had restored the
      city to the senate and people of Rome, and their Temples to the gods: the
      soldier's pride is his camp, it is his country and his home. If they could
      not regain it at once, they must spend the night in fighting. The
      Vitellians, for their part, had numbers and fortune against them, but by
      marring their enemy's victory, by postponing <a name="2page96"></a><span
      class="pagenum">96</span>peace, by fouling houses and altars with their
      blood, they embraced the last consolations that the conquered can enjoy.
      Many lay more dead than alive on the towers and ramparts of the walls and
      there expired. When the gates were torn down, the remainder faced the
      conquerors in a body. And there they fell, every man of them facing the
      enemy with all his wounds in front. Even as they died they took care to
      make an honourable end.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the city was taken, Vitellius left the Palace by a back way and was
      carried in a litter to his wife's house on the Aventine. If he could lie
      hid during the day, he hoped to make his escape to his brother and the
      Guards at Tarracina. But it is in the very nature of terror that, while
      any course looks dangerous, the present state of things seems worst of
      all. His fickle determination soon changed and he returned to the vast,
      deserted Palace, whence even the lowest of his menials had fled, or at
      least avoided meeting him. Shuddering at the solitude and hushed silence
      of the place, he wandered about, trying closed doors, terrified to find
      the rooms empty; until at last, wearied with his miserable search, he
      crept into some shameful hiding-place. There Julius Placidus, an officer
      of the Guards, found him and dragged him out. His hands were tied behind
      his back, his clothes were torn, and thus he was led forth&mdash;a loathly
      spectacle at which many hurled insults and no one shed a single tear of
      pity. The ignominy of his end killed all compassion. On the way a soldier
      of the German army either <a name="2page97"></a><span class="pagenum">97</span>aimed
      an angry blow at him, or tried to put him out of his shame, or meant,
      perhaps, to strike the officer in command; at any rate, he cut off the
      officer's ear and was immediately stabbed. <a name="IIIchap85"
      id="IIIchap85"></a><span class="chapnum">85</span>With the points of their
      swords they made Vitellius hold up his head and face their insults,
      forcing him again and again to watch his own statues hurtling down, or to
      look at the Rostra and the spot where Galba had been killed. At last he
      was dragged along to the Ladder of <a name="2fnm224"></a>Sighs,<a
      href="#2fn224" class="2fnnum">224</a> where the body of Flavius Sabinus
      had lain. One saying of his which was recorded had a ring of true
      nobility. When some officer flung reproaches at him, he answered, 'And yet
      I was once your emperor.' After that he fell under a shower of wounds, and
      when he was dead the mob abused him as loudly as they had flattered him in
      his lifetime&mdash;and with as little reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IIIchap86" id="IIIchap86"></a><span class="chapnum">86</span>Vitellius'
      home was at <a name="2fnm225"></a>Luceria.<a href="#2fn225" class="2fnnum">225</a>
      He was in his fifty-seventh year, and had won the consulship, priesthoods,
      and a name and position among Rome's greatest men, all of which he owed to
      no efforts of his own, but solely to his father's <a name="2fnm226"></a>eminence.<a
      href="#2fn226" class="2fnnum">226</a> Those who offered him the throne had
      not yet learnt to know him; and yet his slothful cowardice won from his
      soldiers an enthusiasm which the best of generals have rarely evoked.
      Still he had the qualities of candour and generosity, which without
      moderation are <a name="2page98"></a><span class="pagenum">98</span>liable
      to prove disastrous. He had few friends, though he bought many, thinking
      to keep them, not by showing moral stamina, but by giving liberal
      presents. It was indubitably good for the country that Vitellius should be
      beaten. But those who betrayed him to Vespasian can hardly make a merit of
      their perfidy, for they were the very men who had deserted Galba for
      Vitellius.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was already sinking into evening. The magistrates and senators had
      fled in terror from the city, or were still in hiding at dependants'
      houses: it was therefore impossible to call a meeting of the senate. When
      all fear of violence was at an end, Domitian came <a name="2fnm227"></a>out<a
      href="#2fn227" class="2fnnum">227</a> and presented himself to the
      generals of his party. The crowds of soldiers at once hailed him as
      Caesar, and marched off, still in full armour, to escort him to his
      father's house.

      <a name="IVchap1" id="IVchap1"></a><span class="chapnum">1</span>The death
      of Vitellius ended the war without inaugurating peace. The victors
      remained under arms, and the defeated Vitellians were hunted through the
      city with implacable hatred, and butchered promiscuously wherever they
      were found. The streets were choked with corpses; squares and temples ran
      with blood. Soon the riot knew no restraint; they began to hunt for those
      who were in hiding and to drag them out. All who were tall and of youthful
      appearance, whether soldiers or civilians, were cut down <a name="2fnm228"></a>indiscriminately.<a
      href="#2fn228" class="2fnnum">228</a> While their rage was fresh they
      sated their savage cravings with blood; then suddenly the instinct of
      greed prevailed. On the pretext of hunting for hidden enemies, they would
      leave no door unopened and regard no privacy. Thus they began to rifle
      private houses or else made resistance an excuse for murder. There were
      plenty of needy citizens, too, and of rascally slaves, who were perfectly
      ready to betray wealthy householders: others were indicated by their
      friends. From all sides came cries of mourning <a name="2page100"></a><span
      class="pagenum">100</span>and misery. Rome was like a captured city.
      People even longed to have the insolent soldiery of Otho and Vitellius
      back again, much as they had been hated. The Flavian generals, who had
      fanned the flame of civil war with such energy, were incapable of using
      their victory temperately. In riot and disorder the worst characters take
      the lead; peace and quiet call for the highest qualities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap2" id="IVchap2"></a><span class="chapnum">2</span>Domitian
      having secured the title and the official residence of a <a name="2fnm229"></a>Caesar,<a
      href="#2fn229" class="2fnnum">229</a> did not as yet busy himself with
      serious matters, but in his character of emperor's son devoted himself to
      dissolute intrigues. Arrius <a name="2fnm230"></a>Varus<a href="#2fn230"
      class="2fnnum">230</a> took command of the Guards, but the supreme
      authority rested with Antonius Primus. He removed money and slaves from
      the emperor's house as though he were plundering Cremona. The other
      generals, from excess of modesty or lack of spirit, shared neither the
      distinctions of the war nor the profits of peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      People in Rome were now so nervous and so resigned to despotism that they
      demanded that Lucius Vitellius and his force of Guards should be surprised
      on their way back from <a name="2fnm231"></a>Tarracina,<a href="#2fn231"
      class="2fnnum">231</a> and the last sparks of the war stamped out. Some
      cavalry were sent forward to Aricia, while the column of the legions
      halted short of Bovillae.<a name="2fnm232"></a><a href="#2fn232"
      class="2fnnum">232</a> Vitellius, however, lost no time in surrendering
      himself and his Guards to the conqueror's <a name="2page101"></a><span
      class="pagenum">101</span>discretion, and the men flung away their unlucky
      swords more in anger than in fear. The long line of prisoners filed
      through the city between ranks of armed guards. None looked like begging
      for mercy. With sad, set faces they remained sternly indifferent to the
      applause or the mockery of the ribald crowd. A few tried to break away,
      but were surrounded and overpowered. The rest were put in prison. Not one
      of them gave vent to any unseemly complaint. Through all their misfortunes
      they preserved their reputation for courage. Lucius Vitellius was then
      executed. He was as weak as his brother, though during the principate he
      showed himself less indolent. Without sharing his brother's success, he
      was carried away on the flood of his disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap3" id="IVchap3"></a><span class="chapnum">3</span>At this
      time Lucilius <a name="2fnm233"></a>Bassus<a href="#2fn233" class="2fnnum">233</a>
      was sent off with a force of light horse to quell the disquiet in
      Campania, which was caused more by the mutual jealousy of the townships
      than by any opposition to the emperor. The sight of the soldiers restored
      order. The smaller colonies were pardoned, but at Capua the Third <a
      name="2fnm234"></a>legion<a href="#2fn234" class="2fnnum">234</a> was left
      in winter quarters and some of the leading families fined.<a name="2fnm235"></a><a
      href="#2fn235" class="2fnnum">235</a> Tarracina, on the other hand,
      received no relief. It is always easier to requite an injury than a
      service: gratitude is a burden, but revenge is found to pay. Their only
      consolation was that one of Vergilius Capito's slaves, who had, as we <a
      name="2page102"></a><span class="pagenum">102</span>have <a name="2fnm236"></a>seen,<a
      href="#2fn236" class="2fnnum">236</a> betrayed the town, was hanged on the
      gallows with the very <a name="2fnm237"></a>rings<a href="#2fn237"
      class="2fnnum">237</a> on his fingers which Vitellius had given him to
      wear.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Rome the senate decreed to Vespasian all the usual prerogatives of the
      <a name="2fnm238"></a>principate.<a href="#2fn238" class="2fnnum">238</a>
      They were now happy and confident. Seeing that the civil war had broken
      out in the provinces of Gaul and Spain, and after causing a rebellion
      first in Germany and then in Illyricum, had spread to Egypt, Judaea, <a
      name="2fnm239"></a>Syria,<a href="#2fn239" class="2fnnum">239</a> and in
      fact to all the provinces and armies of the empire, they felt that the
      world had been purged as by fire and that all was now over. Their
      satisfaction was still further enhanced by a letter from Vespasian, which
      at first sight seemed to be phrased as if the war was still going on.
      Still his tone was that of an emperor, though he spoke of himself as a
      simple citizen and gave his country all the glory. The senate for its part
      showed no lack of deference. They decreed that Vespasian himself should be
      consul with Titus for his colleague, and on Domitian they conferred the
      praetorship with the powers of a consul.<a name="2fnm240"></a><a
      href="#2fn240" class="2fnnum">240</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap4" id="IVchap4"></a><span class="chapnum">4</span>Mucianus
      had also addressed a letter to the senate <a name="2page103"></a><span
      class="pagenum">103</span>which gave rise to a good deal of <a
      name="2fnm241"></a>talk.<a href="#2fn241" class="2fnnum">241</a> If he
      were a private citizen, why adopt the official tone? He could have
      expressed the same opinions a few days later from his place in the House.
      Besides, his attack on Vitellius came too late to prove his independence,
      and what seemed particularly humiliating for the country and insulting to
      the emperor was his boast that he had held the empire in the hollow of his
      hand, and had given it to Vespasian. However, they concealed their
      ill-will and made a great show of flattery, decreeing to Mucianus in the
      most complimentary terms full triumphal honours, which were really given
      him for his success against his fellow countrymen, though they trumped up
      an expedition to Sarmatia as a <a name="2fnm242"></a>pretext.<a
      href="#2fn242" class="2fnnum">242</a> On Antonius Primus they conferred
      the insignia of the consulship, and those of the praetorship on Cornelius
      Fuscus and Arrius Varus. Then came the turn of the gods: it was decided to
      restore the Capitol. These proposals were all moved by the
      consul-designate, Valerius <a name="2fnm243"></a>Asiaticus.<a
      href="#2fn243" class="2fnnum">243</a> The others signified assent by
      smiling and holding up their hands, though a few, who were particularly
      distinguished, or especially practised in the art of flattery, delivered
      set speeches. When it came to the turn of Helvidius Priscus, the
      praetor-designate, he expressed himself in terms which, while doing honour
      to a good emperor, were perfectly frank <a name="2page104"></a><span
      class="pagenum">104</span>and <a name="2fnm244"></a>honest.<a
      href="#2fn244" class="2fnnum">244</a> The senate showed their keen
      approval, and it was this day which first won for him great disfavour and
      great distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap5" id="IVchap5"></a><span class="chapnum">5</span>Since I
      have had occasion to make a second <a name="2fnm245"></a>allusion<a
      href="#2fn245" class="2fnnum">245</a> to a man whom I shall often have to
      mention <a name="2fnm246"></a>again,<a href="#2fn246" class="2fnnum">246</a>
      it may be well to give here a brief account of his character and ideals,
      and of his fortune in life. Helvidius Priscus came from the country town
      of Cluviae.<a name="2fnm247"></a><a href="#2fn247" class="2fnnum">247</a>
      His father had been a senior centurion in the army. From his early youth
      Helvidius devoted his great intellectual powers to the higher studies, not
      as many people do, with the idea of using a philosopher's reputation as a
      cloak for <a name="2fnm248"></a>indolence,<a href="#2fn248" class="2fnnum">248</a>
      but rather to fortify himself against the caprice of fortune when he
      entered public life. He became a follower of that school of <a
      name="2fnm249"></a>philosophy<a href="#2fn249" class="2fnnum">249</a>
      which holds that honesty is the one good thing in life and sin the only
      evil, while power and rank and other such external things, not being
      qualities of character, are neither good nor bad. He had risen no higher
      than the rank of quaestor when Paetus Thrasea chose him for his
      son-in-law,<a name="2fnm250"></a><a href="#2fn250" class="2fnnum">250</a>
      and of Thrasea's virtues he absorbed none so much as his independence. As
      citizen, senator, husband, son-in-law, friend, in every sphere of life he
      was thoroughly consistent, always showing contempt <a name="2page105"></a><span
      class="pagenum">105</span>for money, stubborn persistence in the right,
      and courage in the face of danger. <a name="IVchap6" id="IVchap6"></a><span
      class="chapnum">6</span>Some people thought him too ambitious, for even
      with philosophers the passion for fame is often their last rag of
      infirmity. After Thrasea's fall Helvidius was banished, but he returned to
      Rome under Galba and proceeded to prosecute Eprius <a name="2fnm251"></a>Marcellus,<a
      href="#2fn251" class="2fnnum">251</a> who had informed against his
      father-in-law. This attempt to secure a revenge, as bold as it was just,
      divided the senate into two parties, for the fall of Marcellus would
      involve the ruin of a whole army of similar offenders. At first the
      struggle was full of recrimination, as the famous speeches on either side
      testify; but after a while, finding that Galba's attitude was doubtful and
      that many of the senators begged him to desist, Helvidius dropped the
      prosecution. On his action in this matter men's comments varied with their
      character, some praising his moderation, others asking what had become of
      his tenacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      To return to the senate: at the same meeting at which they voted powers to
      Vespasian they also decided to send a deputation to address him. This gave
      rise to a sharp dispute between Helvidius Priscus and Eprius Marcellus.
      The former thought the members of the deputation ought to be nominated by
      magistrates acting under oath; Marcellus demanded their selection by lot.
      The consul-designate had already spoken in <a name="IVchap7" id="IVchap7"></a><span
      class="chapnum">7</span>favour of the latter method, but Marcellus' motive
      was personal vanity, for he was afraid that if others <a name="2page106"></a><span
      class="pagenum">106</span>were chosen he would seem slighted. Their
      exchange of views gradually grew into a formal and acrimonious debate.
      Helvidius inquired why it was that Marcellus was so afraid of the
      magistrates' judgement, seeing that he himself had great advantages of
      wealth and of eloquence over many others. Could it be the memory of his
      misdeeds that so oppressed him? The fall of the lot could not discern
      character: but the whole point of submitting people to the vote and to
      scrutiny by the senate was to get at the truth about each man's life and
      reputation. In the interest of the country, and out of respect to
      Vespasian, it was important that he should be met by men whom the senate
      considered beyond reproach, men who would give the emperor a taste for
      honest language. Vespasian had been a friend of Thrasea, Soranus, and <a
      name="2fnm252"></a>Sentius,<a href="#2fn252" class="2fnnum">252</a> and
      even though there might be no need to punish their prosecutors, still it
      would be wrong to put them forward. Moreover, the senate's selection would
      be a sort of hint to the emperor whom to approve and whom to avoid. 'Good
      friends are the most effective instruments of good government. Marcellus
      ought to be content with having driven Nero to destroy so many innocent
      people. Let him enjoy the impunity and the profit he has won from that,
      and leave Vespasian to more honest advisers.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="2page107"></a><span class="pagenum">107</span><a name="IVchap8"
      id="IVchap8"></a><span class="chapnum">8</span>Marcellus replied that the
      opinion which was being impugned was not his own. The consul-designate had
      already advised them to follow the established precedent, which was that
      deputations should be chosen by lot, so that there should be no room for
      intrigue or personal animosity. Nothing had happened to justify them in
      setting aside such an ancient system. Why turn a compliment to the emperor
      into a slight upon some one else? Anybody could do homage. What they had
      to avoid was the possibility that some people's obstinacy might irritate
      the emperor at the outset of his reign, while his intentions were
      undecided and he was still busy watching faces and listening to what was
      said. 'I have not forgotten,' he went on, 'the days of my youth or the
      constitution which our fathers and grandfathers <a name="2fnm253"></a>established.<a
      href="#2fn253" class="2fnnum">253</a> But while admiring a distant past, I
      support the existing state of things. I pray for good emperors, but I take
      them as they come. As for Thrasea, it was not my speech but the senate's
      verdict which did for him. Nero took a savage delight in farces like that
      trial, and, really, the friendship of such an emperor cost me as much
      anxiety as banishment did to others. In fine, Helvidius may be as brave
      and as firm as any Brutus or Cato; I am but a senator and we are all
      slaves together. Besides, I advise my friend not to try and get an upper
      hand with our emperor or to force his tuition on a man of ripe <a
      name="2fnm254"></a>years,<a href="#2fn254" class="2fnnum">254</a> who
      wears the insignia of a triumph and is the father <a name="2page108"></a><span
      class="pagenum">108</span>of two grown sons. Bad rulers like absolute
      sovereignty, and even the best of them must set some limit to their
      subjects' independence.'
    </p>
    <p>
      This heated interchange of arguments found supporters for both views. The
      party which wanted the deputies chosen by lot eventually prevailed, since
      even the moderates were anxious to observe the precedent, and all the most
      prominent members tended to vote with them, for fear of encountering
      ill-feeling if they were selected.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap9" id="IVchap9"></a><span class="chapnum">9</span>This
      dispute was followed by another. The Praetors, who in those days
      administered the <a name="2fnm255"></a>Treasury,<a href="#2fn255"
      class="2fnnum">255</a> complained of the spread of poverty in the country
      and demanded some restriction of expenditure. The consul-designate said
      that, as the undertaking would be so vast and the remedy so difficult, he
      was in favour of leaving it for the emperor. Helvidius maintained that it
      ought to be settled by the senate's decision. When the consuls began to
      take each senator's opinion, Vulcacius Tertullinus, one of the tribunes,
      interposed his veto, on the ground that they could not decide such an
      important question in the emperor's absence. Helvidius had previously
      moved that the Capitol should be restored at the public cost, and with the
      assistance of Vespasian. The moderates all passed over this suggestion in
      silence and soon <a name="2page109"></a><span class="pagenum">109</span>forgot
      it, but there were others who took care to remember <a name="2fnm256"></a>it.<a
      href="#2fn256" class="2fnnum">256</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap10" id="IVchap10"></a><span class="chapnum">10</span>It was
      at this time that Musonius <a name="2fnm257"></a>Rufus<a href="#2fn257"
      class="2fnnum">257</a> brought an action against Publius Celer on the
      ground that it was only by perjury that he had secured the conviction of
      Soranus <a name="2fnm258"></a>Barea.<a href="#2fn258" class="2fnnum">258</a>
      It was felt that this trial restarted the hue and cry against professional
      accusers. But the defendant was a rascal of no importance who could not be
      sheltered, and, moreover, Barea's memory was sacred. Celer had set up as a
      teacher of philosophy and then committed perjury against his pupil Barea,
      thus treacherously violating the very principles of friendship which he
      professed to teach. The case was put down for the next day's <a
      name="2fnm259"></a>meeting.<a href="#2fn259" class="2fnnum">259</a> But
      now that a taste for revenge was aroused, people were all agog to see not
      so much Musonius and Publius as Priscus and Marcellus and the rest in
      court.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap11" id="IVchap11"></a><span class="chapnum">11</span>Thus
      the senate quarrelled; the defeated party nursed their grievances; the
      winners had no power to enforce their will; law was in abeyance and the
      emperor absent. This state of things continued until Mucianus arrived in
      Rome and took everything into his own hands. This shattered the supremacy
      of Antonius and Varus, for, though Mucianus tried to show a friendly face
      towards them, he was not very <a name="2page110"></a><span class="pagenum">110</span>successful
      in concealing his dislike. But the people of Rome, having acquired great
      skill in detecting strained relations, had already transferred their
      allegiance. Mucianus was now the sole object of their flattering
      attentions. And he lived up to them. He surrounded himself with an armed
      escort, and kept changing his house and gardens. His display, his public
      appearances, the night-watch that guarded him, all showed that he had
      adopted the style of an emperor while forgoing the title. The greatest
      alarm was aroused by his execution of Calpurnius Galerianus, a son of
      Caius <a name="2fnm260"></a>Piso.<a href="#2fn260" class="2fnnum">260</a>
      He had attempted no treachery, but his distinguished name and handsome
      presence had made the youth a subject of common talk, and the country was
      full of turbulent spirits who delighted in revolutionary rumours and idly
      talked of his coming to the throne. Mucianus gave orders that he should be
      arrested by a body of soldiers, and to avoid a conspicuous execution in
      the heart of the city, they marched him forty miles along the Appian road,
      where they severed his veins and let him bleed to death. Julius Priscus,
      who had commanded the Guards under Vitellius, committed suicide, more from
      shame than of necessity. Alfenus Varus survived the disgrace of his
      cowardice.<a name="2fnm261"></a><a href="#2fn261" class="2fnnum">261</a>

      <a name="IVchap12" id="IVchap12"></a><span class="chapnum">12</span>The
      growing rumour of a reverse in <a name="2fnm264"></a>Germany<a
      href="#2fn264" class="2fnnum">264</a> had not as yet caused any alarm in
      Rome. People alluded to the loss of armies, the capture of the legions'
      winter quarters, the defection of the Gallic provinces as matters of
      indifference. I must now go back and explain the origin of this war, and
      of the widespread rebellion of foreign and allied tribes which now broke
      into flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Batavi were once a tribe of the <a name="2fnm265"></a>Chatti,<a
      href="#2fn265" class="2fnnum">265</a> living on the further bank of the
      Rhine. But an outbreak of civil war had driven them across the river,
      where they settled in a still unoccupied district on the frontier of Gaul
      and also in the neighbouring island, enclosed on one side by the ocean and
      on the other three sides by the <a name="2fnm266"></a>Rhine.<a
      href="#2fn266" class="2fnnum">266</a> There they fared better than most
      tribes who ally themselves to a stronger power. Their resources are still
      intact, and they have only to contribute men and arms for the imperial
      <a name="2fnm267"></a>army.<a href="#2fn267" class="2fnnum">267</a> After
      <a name="2page112"></a><span class="pagenum">112</span>a long training in
      the German wars, they still further increased their reputation in Britain,
      where their troops had been sent, commanded according to an ancient custom
      by some of the noblest chiefs. There still remained behind in their own
      country a picked troop of horsemen with a peculiar knack of swimming,
      which enabled them to make a <a name="2fnm268"></a>practice<a
      href="#2fn268" class="2fnnum">268</a> of crossing the Rhine with unbroken
      ranks without losing control of their horses or their weapons.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap13" id="IVchap13"></a><span class="chapnum">13</span>Of
      their chieftains two outshone the rest. These were Julius Paulus and
      Julius Civilis, both of royal stock. Paulus had been executed by Fonteius
      Capito on a false charge of rebellion.<a name="2fnm269"></a><a
      href="#2fn269" class="2fnnum">269</a> On the same occasion Civilis was
      sent in chains to Nero. Galba, however, set him free, and under Vitellius
      he again ran great risk of his life, when the army clamoured for his
      execution.<a name="2fnm270"></a><a href="#2fn270" class="2fnnum">270</a>
      This gave him a motive for hating Rome, and our misfortunes fed his hopes.
      He was, indeed, far cleverer than most barbarians, and professed to be a
      second Sertorius or Hannibal, because they all three had the same physical
      <a name="2fnm271"></a>defect.<a href="#2fn271" class="2fnnum">271</a> He
      was afraid that if he openly rebelled against the Roman people they would
      treat him as an enemy, and march on him at once, so he pretended to be a
      keen supporter of Vespasian's party. This much was true, that Antonius<a
      name="2page113"></a><span class="pagenum">113</span> Primus had written
      instructing him to divert the auxiliaries whom Vitellius had summoned, and
      to delay the legions on the pretence of a rising in Germany. Moreover,
      Hordeonius <a name="2fnm272"></a>Flaccus<a href="#2fn272" class="2fnnum">272</a>
      had given him the same advice in person, for Flaccus was inclined to
      support Vespasian and anxious for the safety of Rome, which was threatened
      with utter disaster, if the war were to break out afresh and all these
      thousands of troops come pouring into Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap14" id="IVchap14"></a><span class="chapnum">14</span>Having
      thus made up his mind to rebel, Civilis concealed in the meantime his
      ulterior design, and while intending to guide his ultimate policy by
      future events, proceeded to initiate the rising as follows. The young
      Batavians were by Vitellius' orders being pressed for service, and this
      burden was being rendered even more irksome than it need have been by the
      greed and depravity of the recruiting officers. They took to enrolling
      elderly men and invalids so as to get bribes for excusing them: or, as
      most of the Batavi are tall and good-looking in their youth, they would
      seize the handsomest boys for immoral purposes. This caused bad feeling;
      an agitation was organized, and they were persuaded to refuse service.
      Accordingly, on the pretext of giving a banquet, Civilis summoned the
      chief nobles and the most determined of the tribesmen to a sacred grove.
      Then, when he saw them excited by their revelry and the late hour of the
      night, he began to speak of the glorious past of the Batavi and to
      enumerate the wrongs they had suffered, the injustice <a name="2page114"></a><span
      class="pagenum">114</span>and extortion and all the evils of their
      slavery. 'We are no longer treated,' he said, 'as we used to be, like
      allies, but like menials and slaves. Why, we are never even visited by an
      imperial <a name="2fnm273"></a>Governor<a href="#2fn273" class="2fnnum">273</a>&mdash;irksome
      though the insolence of his staff would be. We are given over to prefects
      and centurions; and when these subordinates have had their fill of
      extortion and of bloodshed, they promptly find some one to replace them,
      and then there are new pockets to fill and new pretexts for plunder. Now
      conscription is upon us: children are to be torn from parents, brother
      from brother, never, probably, to meet again. And yet the fortunes of Rome
      were never more depressed. Their cantonments contain nothing but loot and
      a lot of old men. Lift up your eyes and look at them. There is nothing to
      fear from legions that only exist on <a name="2fnm274"></a>paper.<a
      href="#2fn274" class="2fnnum">274</a> And we are strong. We have infantry
      and cavalry: the Germans are our kinsmen: the Gauls share our ambition.
      Even the Romans will be grateful if we go to <a name="2fnm275"></a>war.<a
      href="#2fn275" class="2fnnum">275</a> If we fail, we can claim credit for
      supporting Vespasian: if we succeed, there will be no one to call us to
      account.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap15" id="IVchap15"></a><span class="chapnum">15</span>His
      speech was received with great approval, and he at once bound them all to
      union, using the barbarous ceremonies and strange oaths of his country.
      They <a name="2page115"></a><span class="pagenum">115</span>then sent to
      the Canninefates to join their enterprise. This tribe inhabits part of the
      <a name="2fnm276"></a>Island,<a href="#2fn276" class="2fnnum">276</a> and
      though inferior in numbers to the Batavi, they are of the same race and
      language and the same courageous spirit. Civilis next sent secret messages
      to win over the Batavian troops, which after serving as Roman auxiliaries
      in Britain had been sent, as we have already seen,<a name="2fnm277"></a><a
      href="#2fn277" class="2fnnum">277</a> to Germany and were now stationed at
      <a name="2fnm278"></a>Mainz.<a href="#2fn278" class="2fnnum">278</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the Canninefates, Brinno by name, was a man of distinguished family
      and stubborn courage. His father had often ventured acts of hostility, and
      had with complete impunity shown his contempt for Caligula's farcical <a
      name="2fnm279"></a>expedition.<a href="#2fn279" class="2fnnum">279</a> To
      belong to such a family of rebels was in itself a recommendation. He was
      accordingly placed on a shield, swung up on the shoulders of his friends,
      and thus elected leader after the fashion of the tribe. Summoning to his
      aid the <a name="2fnm280"></a>Frisii<a href="#2fn280" class="2fnnum">280</a>&mdash;a
      tribe from beyond the Rhine&mdash;he fell upon two cohorts of auxiliaries
      whose camp lay close to the neighbouring <a name="2fnm281"></a>shore.<a
      href="#2fn281" class="2fnnum">281</a> The attack was unexpected, and the
      troops, even if they had foreseen it, were not strong enough to offer
      resistance: so the camp was taken and looted. They then fell on the Roman
      camp-<a name="2page116"></a><span class="pagenum">116</span>followers and
      traders, who had gone off in all directions as if peace were assured.
      Finding the forts now threatened with destruction, the Roman officers set
      fire to them, as they had no means of defence. All the troops with their
      standards and colours retired in a body to the upper end of the island,
      led by Aquilius, a senior centurion. But they were an army in name only,
      not in strength, for Vitellius had withdrawn all the efficient soldiers
      and had replaced them by a useless mob, who had been drawn from the
      neighbouring Nervian and German villages and were only embarrassed by
      their <a name="2fnm282"></a>armour.<a href="#2fn282" class="2fnnum">282</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap16" id="IVchap16"></a><span class="chapnum">16</span>Civilis
      thought it best to proceed by guile, and actually ventured to blame the
      Roman officers for abandoning the forts. He could, he told them, with the
      cohort under his command, suppress the outbreak of the Canninefates
      without their assistance: they could all go back to their winter-quarters.
      However, it was plain that some treachery underlay his advice&mdash;it
      would be easier to crush the cohorts if they were separated&mdash;and also
      that Civilis, not Brinno, was at the head of this war. Evidence of this
      gradually leaked out, as the Germans loved war too well to keep <a
      name="2page117"></a><span class="pagenum">117</span>the secret for long.
      Finding his artifice unsuccessful, Civilis tried force instead, forming
      the Canninefates, Frisii and Batavi into three separate columns.<a
      name="2fnm283"></a><a href="#2fn283" class="2fnnum">283</a> The Roman line
      faced them in position near the Rhine bank.<a name="2fnm284"></a><a
      href="#2fn284" class="2fnnum">284</a> They had brought their ships there
      after the burning of the forts, and these were now turned with their prows
      towards the enemy. Soon after the engagement began a Tungrian cohort
      deserted to Civilis, and the Romans were so startled by this unexpected
      treachery that they were cut to pieces by their allies and their enemies
      combined. Similar treachery occurred in the fleet. Some of the rowers, who
      were Batavians, feigning clumsiness tried to impede the sailors and
      marines in the performance of their functions, and after a while openly
      resisted them and turned the ships' sterns towards the enemy's bank.
      Finally, they killed the pilots and centurions who refused to join them,
      and thus all the twenty-four ships of the flotilla either deserted to the
      enemy or were captured by them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap17" id="IVchap17"></a><span class="chapnum">17</span>This
      victory made Civilis immediately famous and proved subsequently very
      useful. Having now got the ships and the weapons which they needed, he and
      his <a name="2page118"></a><span class="pagenum">118</span>followers were
      enthusiastically proclaimed as champions of liberty throughout Germany and
      Gaul. The German provinces immediately sent envoys with offers of help,
      while Civilis endeavoured by diplomacy and by bribery to secure an
      alliance with the Gauls. He sent back the auxiliary officers whom he had
      taken prisoner, each to his own tribe, and offered the cohorts the choice
      of either going home or remaining with him. Those who remained were given
      an honourable position in his army: and those who went home received
      presents out of the Roman spoil. At the same time Civilis talked to them
      confidentially and reminded them of the miseries they had endured for all
      these years, in which they had disguised their wretched slavery under the
      name of peace. 'The Batavi,' he would say, 'were excused from taxation,
      and yet they have taken arms against the common tyrant. In the first
      engagement the Romans were routed and beaten. What if Gaul throws off the
      yoke? What forces are there left in Italy? It is with the blood of
      provincials that their provinces are won. Don't think of the defeat of .
      Why, it was the Batavian cavalry which trampled on the Aedui and <a
      name="2fnm285"></a>Arverni,<a href="#2fn285" class="2fnnum">285</a> and
      there were Belgic auxiliaries in Verginius' force. The truth is that Gaul
      succumbed to her own armies. But now we are all united in one party,
      fortified, moreover, by the military discipline which prevails in Roman
      camps:<a name="2page119"></a><span class="pagenum">119</span> and we have
      on our side the veterans before whom Otho's legions lately bit the dust.
      Let Syria and Asia play the slave: the East is used to tyrants: but there
      are many still living in Gaul who were born before the days of <a
      name="2fnm286"></a>tribute.<a href="#2fn286" class="2fnnum">286</a>
      Indeed, it is only the other <a name="2fnm287"></a>day<a href="#2fn287"
      class="2fnnum">287</a> that Quintilius Varus was killed, when slavery was
      driven out of Germany, and they brought into the field not the Emperor
      Vitellius but Caesar Augustus himself. Why, liberty is the natural
      prerogative even of dumb animals: courage is the peculiar attribute of
      man. Heaven helps the brave. Come, then, fall upon them while your hands
      are free and theirs are tied, while you are fresh and they are weary. Some
      of them are for Vespasian, others for Vitellius; now is your chance to
      crush both parties at once.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap18" id="IVchap18"></a><span class="chapnum">18</span>Civilis
      thus had his eye on Gaul and Germany and aspired, had his project
      prospered, to become king of two countries, one pre-eminent in wealth and
      the other in military strength.

          The Nervii were a Gallic tribe living on the Sambre, with settlements
          at Cambray, Tournay, Bavay. Ritter's alteration of <i>Germanorum</i>
          to <i>Cugernorum</i> is very probably right. They lived about a dozen
          miles west of Vetera, and are thus a likely recruiting-ground. They
          were of German origin, so if <i>Germanorum</i> is right, the reference
          will still be to them and the Tungri and other German Settlements on
          the east of the Rhine.

          a V-shaped formation. Tacitus' phrase in <i>Germ.</i> 6 is generally
          taken to mean that the Germans fought in wedge-formation. The
          separation of the three tribes in three columns was also typical of
          German tactics. The presence of kinsmen stimulated courage.

      <a name="The_Mutiny" id="The_Mutiny"></a>The Mutiny of the Batavian
      Cohorts
    </h3>
    <p>
      Hordeonius Flaccus at first furthered Civilis' schemes by shutting his
      eyes to them. But when messengers kept arriving in panic with news that a
      camp had been stormed, cohorts wiped out, and not a Roman left in the
      Batavian Island, he instructed<a name="2page120"></a><span class="pagenum">120</span>
      Munius Lupercus, who commanded the two <a name="2fnm288"></a>legions<a
      href="#2fn288" class="2fnnum">288</a> in winter-quarters,<a name="2fnm289"></a><a
      href="#2fn289" class="2fnnum">289</a> to march against the enemy. Lupercus
      lost no time in crossing the <a name="2fnm290"></a>river,<a href="#2fn290"
      class="2fnnum">290</a> taking the legions whom he had with him, some <a
      name="2fnm291"></a>Ubii<a href="#2fn291" class="2fnnum">291</a> who were
      close at hand, and the Treviran cavalry who were stationed not far away.
      To this force he added a regiment of Batavian cavalry, who, though their
      loyalty had long ago succumbed, still concealed the fact, because they
      hoped their desertion would fetch a higher price, if they actually
      betrayed the Romans on the field. Civilis set the standards of the
      defeated <a name="2fnm292"></a>cohorts<a href="#2fn292" class="2fnnum">292</a>
      round him in a ring to keep their fresh honours before the eyes of his
      men, and to terrify the enemy by reminding them of their disaster. He also
      gave orders that his own mother and sisters and all the wives and small
      children of his soldiers should be stationed in the rear to spur them to
      victory or shame them if they were <a name="2fnm293"></a>beaten.<a
      href="#2fn293" class="2fnnum">293</a> When his line raised their
      battle-cry, the men singing and the women shrieking, the legions and their
      auxiliaries replied with a comparatively feeble cheer, for their left wing
      had been exposed by the desertion of the Batavian cavalry, who promptly
      turned against us. However, despite the confusion, the <a name="2page121"></a><span
      class="pagenum">121</span>legionaries gripped their swords and kept their
      places. Then the Ubian and Treviran auxiliaries broke in shameful flight
      and went wandering all over the country. The Germans pressed hard on their
      heels and meanwhile the legions could make good their escape into the
      camp, which was called 'Castra Vetera'.<a name="2fnm294"></a><a
      href="#2fn294" class="2fnnum">294</a> Claudius Labeo, who commanded the
      Batavian cavalry, had opposed Civilis as a rival in some petty municipal
      dispute. Civilis was afraid that, if he killed him, he might offend his
      countrymen, while if he spared him his presence would give rise to
      dissension; so he sent him off by sea to the Frisii.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap19" id="IVchap19"></a><span class="chapnum">19</span>It was
      at this time that the cohorts of Batavians and Canninefates, on their way
      to Rome under orders from Vitellius, received the message which Civilis
      had sent to <a name="2fnm295"></a>them.<a href="#2fn295" class="2fnnum">295</a>
      They promptly fell into a ferment of unruly insolence and demanded a
      special grant as payment for their journey, double pay, and an increase in
      the number of their <a name="2fnm296"></a>cavalry.<a href="#2fn296"
      class="2fnnum">296</a> Although all these things had been promised by
      Vitellius they had no hope of obtaining them, but wanted an excuse for
      rebellion. Flaccus made many concessions, but the only result was that
      they redoubled their vigour and demanded what they felt sure he would
      refuse. Paying no further heed to him they made for Lower Germany, <a
      name="2page122"></a><span class="pagenum">122</span>to join Civilis.
      Flaccus summoned the tribunes and centurions and debated with them whether
      he should use force to punish this defiance of authority. After a while he
      gave way to his natural cowardice and the fears of his subordinates, who
      were distressed by the thought that the loyalty of the auxiliaries was
      doubtful and that the legions had been recruited by a hurried levy. It was
      decided, therefore, to keep the soldiers in <a name="2fnm297"></a>camp.<a
      href="#2fn297" class="2fnnum">297</a> However, he soon changed his mind
      when he found himself criticized by the very men whose advice he had
      taken. He now seemed bent on pursuit, and wrote to Herennius Gallus in
      command of the First legion, who was holding Bonn, telling him to bar the
      path of the Batavians, and promising that he and his army would follow
      hard upon their heels. The rebels might certainly have been crushed had
      Flaccus and Gallus each advanced their forces from opposite directions and
      thus surrounded them. But Flaccus soon gave up the idea, and wrote another
      letter to Gallus, warning him to let the rebels pass undisturbed. This
      gave rise to a suspicion that the generals were purposely promoting the
      war; and all the disasters which had already occurred or were feared in
      the future, were attributed not to the soldiers' inefficiency or the
      strength of the enemy, but to the treachery of the generals.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap20" id="IVchap20"></a><span class="chapnum">20</span>On
      nearing the camp at Bonn, the Batavians sent forward a messenger to
      explain their intentions to Herennius Gallus. Against the Romans, for whom
      <a name="2page123"></a><span class="pagenum">123</span>they had fought so
      often, they had no wish to make war: but they were worn out after a long
      and unprofitable term of service and wanted to go home and rest. If no one
      opposed them they would march peaceably by; but if hostility was offered
      they would find a passage at the point of the sword. Gallus hesitated, but
      his men induced him to risk an engagement. Three thousand legionaries,
      some hastily recruited Belgic auxiliaries, and a mob of peasants and
      camp-followers, who were as cowardly in action as they were boastful
      before it, came pouring out simultaneously from all the gates, hoping with
      their superior numbers to surround the Batavians. But these were
      experienced veterans. They formed up into <a name="2fnm298"></a>columns<a
      href="#2fn298" class="2fnnum">298</a> in deep formation that defied
      assault on front, flank, or rear. They thus pierced our thinner line. The
      Belgae giving way, the legion was driven back and ran in terror to reach
      the trench and the gates of the camp. It was there that we suffered the
      heaviest losses. The trenches were filled with dead, who were not all
      killed by the blows of the enemy, for many were stifled in the press or
      perished on each other's swords. The victorious cohorts avoided Cologne
      and marched on without attempting any further hostilities. For the battle
      at Bonn they continued to excuse themselves. They had asked for peace,
      they said, and when peace was persistently refused, had merely acted in
      self-defence.

          Vetera as a proper name, it has been kept in the translation. It was

    <h3>
      <a name="The_Siege" id="The_Siege"></a>The Siege of Vetera
    </h3>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap21" id="IVchap21"></a><span class="chapnum">21</span>After
      the arrival of these veteran cohorts Civilis was now at the head of a
      respectable army. But being still uncertain of his plans, and engaged in
      reckoning up the Roman forces, he made all who were with him swear
      allegiance to Vespasian, and sent envoys to the two legions, who after
      their defeat in the former <a name="2fnm299"></a>engagement<a
      href="#2fn299" class="2fnnum">299</a> had retired into Vetera, asking them
      to take the same oath. The answer came back that they never followed the
      advice either of a traitor or of an enemy: Vitellius was their emperor,
      and they would keep their allegiance and their arms for him so long as
      they had breath in their bodies. A Batavian deserter need not try to
      decide the destiny of Rome; he should rather expect the punishment he
      richly deserved. When this was reported to Civilis he flew into a passion,
      and called the whole Batavian people to take arms. They were joined by the
      Bructeri and <a name="2fnm300"></a>Tencteri,<a href="#2fn300"
      class="2fnnum">300</a> and Germany was summoned to come and share the
      plunder and the glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap22" id="IVchap22"></a><span class="chapnum">22</span>Threatened
      with this gathering storm, Munius Lupercus and Numisius Rufus, who were in
      command of the two legions, proceeded to strengthen the ramparts and
      walls. They pulled down the buildings near the military camp, which had
      grown into a small town during the long years of peace, fearing that the
      <a name="2page125"></a><span class="pagenum">125</span>enemy might make
      use of them. But they omitted to provide a sufficient store of provisions
      for the camp, and authorized the soldiers to make up the deficiency by
      looting, with the result that what might have supplied their needs for a
      long time was consumed in a few days. Meanwhile Civilis advanced, himself
      holding the centre with the flower of the Batavi: on both banks of the
      Rhine he massed large bands of Germans to strike terror into the enemy:
      the cavalry galloped through the fields, while the ships were
      simultaneously moved up the stream. Here could be seen the colours of
      veteran Roman cohorts, there the figures of beasts which the Germans had
      brought from their woods and groves, as their tribes do when they go to
      battle. It seemed both a civil and a savage war at once; and this strange
      confusion astounded the besieged. The hopes of the assailants rose when
      they saw the circumference of the ramparts, for there were barely five
      thousand Roman soldiers to defend a camp which had been laid out to hold
      two legions.<a name="2fnm301"></a><a href="#2fn301" class="2fnnum">301</a>
      However, a large number of camp-followers had collected there on the
      break-up of peace, and remained to give what assistance they could to the
      military operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap23" id="IVchap23"></a><span class="chapnum">23</span>The
      camp was built partly on the gentle slope of a hill and partly on the
      level ground. Augustus had believed that it would serve as a base of
      operations and a check upon the German tribes: as for their actually
      coming to assault our legions, such a disaster <a name="2page126"></a><span
      class="pagenum">126</span>never occurred to him. Consequently no trouble
      had been taken in choosing the site or erecting defences: the strength of
      the troops had always seemed sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Batavians and the Germans from across the <a name="2fnm302"></a>Rhine<a
      href="#2fn302" class="2fnnum">302</a> now formed up tribe by tribe&mdash;the
      separation was designed to show their individual prowess&mdash;and opened
      fire from a distance. Finding that most of their missiles fell harmlessly
      on to the turrets and pinnacles of the walls, and that they were being
      wounded by stones hurled from above, they charged with a wild shout and
      surged up to the rampart, some using scaling-ladders, others climbing over
      their comrades who had formed a 'tortoise'. But no sooner had some of them
      begun to scale the wall, than they were hurled down by the besieged, who
      thrust at them with sword and shield, and buried under a shower of stakes
      and javelins. The Germans are always impetuous at the beginning of an
      action and over-confident when they are winning; and on this occasion
      their greed for plunder even steeled them to face difficulties. They
      actually attempted to use siege-engines, with which they were quite
      unfamiliar. But though they had no skill themselves, some of the deserters
      and prisoners showed them how to build a sort of bridge or platform of
      timber, on to which they fitted wheels and rolled it forward. Thus some of
      them stood on this platform and fought as though from a mound, while
      others, concealed inside, tried to undermine the walls. However, stones
      hurled from catapults soon <a name="2page127"></a><span class="pagenum">127</span>destroyed
      this rude engine. Then they began to get ready hurdles and mantlets, but
      the besieged shot blazing spears on to them from engines, and even
      attacked the assailants themselves with fire-darts. At last they gave up
      all hope of an assault and resolved to try a waiting policy, being well
      aware that the camp contained only a few days' provisions and a large
      number of non-combatants. They hoped that famine would breed treason, and
      counted, besides, on the wavering loyalty of the slaves and the usual
      hazards of war to aid them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap24" id="IVchap24"></a><span class="chapnum">24</span>Meanwhile,
      <a name="2fnm303"></a>Flaccus,<a href="#2fn303" class="2fnnum">303</a> who
      had received news of the siege of Vetera, dispatched a party to recruit
      auxiliaries in Gaul, and gave Dillius Vocula, in command of the
      Twenty-second, a force of picked soldiers from his two <a name="2fnm304"></a>legions.<a
      href="#2fn304" class="2fnnum">304</a> Vocula was to hurry by forced
      marches along the bank of the Rhine, while Flaccus himself was to approach
      by water, since he was in bad health and unpopular with his men. Indeed,
      they grumbled openly that he had let the Batavian cohorts get away from
      Mainz, had connived at Civilis' schemes, and invited the Germans to join
      the alliance. Vespasian, they said, owed his rise more to Flaccus than to
      all the assistance of Antonius Primus or of Mucianus, for overt hatred and
      hostility can be openly crushed, but treachery and deceit cannot be
      detected, much less parried. While Civilis took the field himself and
      arranged his own fighting line, Hordeonius lay on a couch in his bedroom
      and gave whatever orders <a name="2page128"></a><span class="pagenum">128</span>best
      suited the enemy's convenience. Why should all these companies of brave
      soldiers be commanded by one miserable old invalid? Let them rather kill
      the traitor and free their brave hearts and good hopes from the incubus of
      such an evil omen. Having worked on each other's feelings by these
      complaints, they were still further incensed by the arrival of a letter
      from Vespasian. As this could not be concealed, Flaccus read it before a
      meeting of the soldiers, and the messengers who brought it were sent to
      Vitellius in chains.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap25" id="IVchap25"></a><span class="chapnum">25</span>With
      feelings thus appeased the army marched on to Bonn, the head-quarters of
      the First legion. There the men were still more indignant with Flaccus, on
      whom they laid the blame of their recent defeat.<a name="2fnm305"></a><a
      href="#2fn305" class="2fnnum">305</a> It was by his orders, they argued,
      that they had taken the field against the Batavians on the understanding
      that the legions from Mainz were in pursuit. But no reinforcements had
      arrived and his treachery was responsible for their losses. The facts,
      moreover, were unknown to the other armies, nor was any report sent to
      their emperor, although this treacherous outbreak could have been nipped
      in the bud by the combined aid of all the provinces. In answer Flaccus
      read out to the army copies of all the letters which he had sent from time
      to time all over Gaul and Britain and Spain to ask for assistance, and
      introduced the disastrous practice of having all letters delivered to the
      standard-bearers of the legions, who read them to the soldiers before the
      general had seen them.<a name="2page129"></a><span class="pagenum">129</span>
      He then gave orders that one of the mutineers should be put in irons, more
      by way of vindicating his authority than because one man was especially to
      blame. Leaving Bonn, the army moved on to Cologne, where they were joined
      by large numbers of Gallic auxiliaries, who at first zealously supported
      the Roman cause: later, when the Germans prospered, most of the tribes
      took arms against us, actuated by hopes of liberty and an ambition to
      establish an empire of their own when once they had shaken off the yoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the army's indignation steadily increased. The imprisonment of a
      single soldier was not enough to terrify them, and, indeed, the prisoner
      actually accused the general of complicity in crime, alleging that he
      himself had carried messages between Flaccus and Civilis. 'It is because I
      can testify to the truth,' he said, 'that Flaccus wants to get rid of me
      on a false charge.' Thereupon Vocula, with admirable self-possession,
      mounted the tribunal and, in spite of the man's protestations, ordered him
      to be seized and led away to prison. This alarmed the disaffected, while
      the better sort obeyed him promptly. The army then unanimously demanded
      that Vocula should lead them, and Flaccus accordingly resigned the chief
      command to him. <a name="IVchap26" id="IVchap26"></a><span class="chapnum">26</span>However,
      there was much to exasperate their disaffection. They were short both of
      pay and of provisions: the Gauls refused either to enlist or to pay
      tribute: drought, usually unknown in that climate, made the Rhine almost
      too low for navigation, and thus hampered their commissariat: patrols had
      <a name="2page130"></a><span class="pagenum">130</span>to be posted at
      intervals all along the bank to prevent the Germans fording the river: and
      in consequence of all this they had less food and more mouths to eat it.
      To the ignorant the lowness of the river seemed in itself an evil omen, as
      though the ancient bulwarks of the empire were now failing them. In peace
      they would have called it bad luck or the course of nature: now it was
      'fate' and 'the anger of heaven'.
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering <a name="2fnm306"></a>Novaesium<a href="#2fn306" class="2fnnum">306</a>
      they were joined by the Sixteenth legion. Herennius <a name="2fnm307"></a>Gallus<a
      href="#2fn307" class="2fnnum">307</a> now shared with Vocula the
      responsibility of command. As they could not venture out against the
      enemy, they encamped ... at a place called <a name="2fnm308"></a>Gelduba,<a
      href="#2fn308" class="2fnnum">308</a> where the soldiers were trained in
      deploying, in fortification and entrenchment, and in various other
      military man&oelig;uvres. To inspire their courage with the further
      incentive of plunder, Vocula led out part of the force against the
      neighbouring tribe of the <a name="2fnm309"></a>Cugerni,<a href="#2fn309"
      class="2fnnum">309</a> who had accepted Civilis' offers of alliance. The
      rest of the troops were left behind with Herennius <a name="2fnm310"></a>Gallus,<a
      href="#2fn310" class="2fnnum">310</a> <a name="IVchap27" id="IVchap27"></a><span
      class="chapnum">27</span>and it happened that a corn-ship with a full
      cargo, which had run aground close to the camp, was towed over by the
      Germans to their own bank. This was more than Gallus could tolerate, so he
      sent a cohort to the rescue. The number of the Germans soon in<a
      name="2page131"></a><span class="pagenum">131</span>creased: both sides
      gradually gathered reinforcements and a regular battle was fought, with
      the result that the Germans towed off the ship, inflicting heavy losses.
      The defeated troops followed what had now become their regular custom, and
      threw the blame not on their own inefficiency but on their
      commanding-officer's bad faith. They dragged him from his quarters, tore
      his uniform and flogged him, bidding him tell them how much he had got for
      betraying the army, and who were his accomplices. Then their indignation
      recoiled on Hordeonius Flaccus: he was the real criminal: Gallus was only
      his tool. At last their threats so terrified Gallus that he, too, charged
      Flaccus with treason. He was put in irons until the arrival of Vocula, who
      at once set him free, and on the next day had the ringleaders of the riot
      executed. The army showed, indeed, a strange contrast in its equal
      readiness to mutiny and to submit to punishment. The common soldiers'
      loyalty to Vitellius was beyond <a name="2fnm311"></a>question,<a
      href="#2fn311" class="2fnnum">311</a> while the higher ranks inclined
      towards Vespasian. Thus we find a succession of outbreaks and penalties;
      an alternation of insubordination with obedience to discipline; for the
      troops could be punished though not controlled.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap28" id="IVchap28"></a><span class="chapnum">28</span>Meanwhile
      the whole of Germany was ready to worship Civilis, sending him vast
      reinforcements and ratifying the alliance with hostages from their noblest
      families. He gave orders that the country of the Ubii and Treviri was to
      be laid waste by their nearest <a name="2page132"></a><span class="pagenum">132</span>neighbours,
      and sent another party across the Maas to harass the Menapii and <a
      name="2fnm312"></a>Morini<a href="#2fn312" class="2fnnum">312</a> and
      other frontier tribes of Gaul. In both quarters they plundered freely, and
      were especially savage towards the Ubii, because they were a tribe of
      German origin who had renounced their fatherland and adopted the name of
      Agrippinenses.<a name="2fnm313"></a><a href="#2fn313" class="2fnnum">313</a>
      A Ubian cohort was cut to pieces at the village of <a name="2fnm314"></a>Marcodurum,<a
      href="#2fn314" class="2fnnum">314</a> where they were off their guard,
      trusting to their distance from the Rhine. The Ubii did not take this
      quietly, nor hesitate to seek reprisals from the Germans, which they did
      at first with impunity. In the end, however, the Germans proved too much
      for them, and throughout the war the Ubii were always more conspicuous for
      good faith than good fortune. Their collapse strengthened Civilis'
      position, and emboldened by success, he now vigorously pressed on the
      blockade of the legions at Vetera, and redoubled his vigilance to prevent
      any message creeping through from the relieving army. The Batavians were
      told off to look after the engines and siege-works: the Germans, who
      clamoured for battle, were sent to demolish the rampart and renew the
      fight directly they were beaten off. There were so many of them that their
      losses mattered little.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap29" id="IVchap29"></a><span class="chapnum">29</span>Nightfall
      did not see the end of their task. They built huge fires of wood all round
      the ramparts and <a name="2page133"></a><span class="pagenum">133</span>sat
      drinking by them; then, as the wine warmed their hearts, one by one they
      dashed into the fight with blind courage. In the darkness their missiles
      were ineffective, but the barbarian troops were clearly visible to the
      Romans, and any one whose daring or bright ornaments made him conspicuous
      at once became a mark for their aim. At last Civilis saw their mistake,
      and gave orders to extinguish the fires and plunge the whole scene into a
      confusion of darkness and the din of arms. Discordant shouts now arose:
      everything was vague and uncertain: no one could see to strike or to
      parry. Wherever a shout was heard, they would wheel round and lunge in
      that direction. Valour was useless: chance and chaos ruled supreme: and
      the bravest soldier often fell under a coward's bolt. The Germans fought
      with blind fury. The Roman troops were more familiar with danger; they
      hurled down iron-clamped stakes and heavy stones with sure effect.
      Wherever the sound of some one climbing or the clang of a scaling-ladder
      betrayed the presence of the enemy, they thrust them back with their
      shields and followed them with a shower of javelins. Many appeared on top
      of the walls, and these they stabbed with their short swords. And so the
      night wore on. <a name="IVchap30" id="IVchap30"></a><span class="chapnum">30</span>Day
      dawned upon new methods of attack. The Batavians had built a wooden tower
      of two stories and moved it up to the Head-quarters <a name="2fnm315"></a>Gate,<a
      href="#2fn315" class="2fnnum">315</a> which was the most accessible spot.
      However, our soldiers, by using strong poles and hurling wooden beams,
      soon <a name="2page134"></a><span class="pagenum">134</span>battered it to
      pieces, with great loss of life to those who were standing on it. While
      they were still dismayed at this, we made a sudden and successful sally.
      Meanwhile the legionaries, with remarkable skill and ingenuity, invented
      still further contrivances. The one which caused most terror was a crane
      with a movable arm suspended over their assailants' heads: this arm was
      suddenly lowered, snatched up one or more of the enemy into the air before
      his fellows' eyes, and, as the heavy end was swung round, tossed him into
      the middle of the camp. Civilis now gave up hope of storming the camp and
      renewed a leisurely blockade, trying all the time by messages and offers
      of reward to undermine the loyalty of the legions.

    <h3>
      <a name="Relief_Vetera" id="Relief_Vetera"></a>The Relief of Vetera
    </h3>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap31" id="IVchap31"></a><span class="chapnum">31</span>Such
      was the course of events in Germany up to the date of the battle of <a
      name="2fnm316"></a>Cremona.<a href="#2fn316" class="2fnnum">316</a> News
      of this arrived by letter from Antonius Primus, who enclosed a copy of
      Caecina's <a name="2fnm317"></a>edict,<a href="#2fn317" class="2fnnum">317</a>
      and Alpinius <a name="2fnm318"></a>Montanus,<a href="#2fn318"
      class="2fnnum">318</a> who commanded one of the defeated auxiliary
      cohorts, came in person to confess that his party had been beaten. The
      troops were variously affected by the news. The Gallic auxiliaries, who
      had no feelings of affection or dislike to either party and served without
      sentiment, <a name="2page135"></a><span class="pagenum">135</span>promptly
      took the advice of their officers and deserted Vitellius. The veterans
      hesitated; under pressure from Flaccus and their officers they eventually
      took the oath of allegiance, but it was clear from their faces that their
      hearts were not in it, and while repeating the rest of the formula they
      boggled at the name of Vespasian, either muttering it under their breath
      or more often omitting it altogether. <a name="IVchap32" id="IVchap32"></a><span
      class="chapnum">32</span>Their suspicions were further inflamed when
      Antonius' letter to Civilis was read out before the meeting; it seemed to
      address Civilis as a member of the Flavian party, and to argue hostility
      to the German army. The news was next brought to the camp at Gelduba,
      where it gave rise to the same comments and the same scenes. Montanus was
      sent to carry instructions to Civilis that he was to cease from
      hostilities and not to make war on Rome under a false pretext; if it was
      to help Vespasian that he had taken arms, he had now achieved his object.
      Civilis at first replied in guarded terms. Then, as he saw that Montanus
      was an impetuous person who would welcome a revolution, he began to
      complain of all the dangers he had endured in the service of Rome for the
      last twenty-five years. 'A fine reward I have received,' he cried, 'for
      all my labours&mdash;my brother's execution,<a name="2fnm319"></a><a
      href="#2fn319" class="2fnnum">319</a> my own imprisonment,<a href="#2fn319"
      class="2fnnum">319</a> and the bloodthirsty clamours of this army, from
      which I claim satisfaction by natural right since they have sought my
      destruction. As for you Trevirans and all the rest that have the souls of
      slaves, what reward do you hope <a name="2page136"></a><span
      class="pagenum">136</span>to gain for shedding your blood so often in the
      cause of Rome, except the thankless task of military service, endless
      taxation, and the rods and axes of these capricious tyrants? Look at me! I
      have only a single cohort under my command, and yet with the Canninefates
      and Batavi, a mere fraction of the Gallic peoples, I am engaged in
      destroying their great useless camp and besieging them with famine and the
      sword. In short, our venture will either end in freedom or, if we are
      beaten, we shall be no worse off than before.' Having thus inflamed
      Montanus he told him to take back a milder answer and dismissed him. On
      his return Montanus pretended that his errand had been fruitless, and said
      nothing about the rest of the interview: but it soon came to light.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap33" id="IVchap33"></a><span class="chapnum">33</span>Retaining
      a portion of his force, Civilis sent the veteran cohorts with the most
      efficient of the German troops against Vocula and his <a name="2fnm320"></a>army.<a
      href="#2fn320" class="2fnnum">320</a> He gave the command to Julius
      Maximus and his nephew Claudius Victor. After rushing the winter-quarters
      of a cavalry regiment at <a name="2fnm321"></a>Asciburgium<a href="#2fn321"
      class="2fnnum">321</a> on their way, they fell upon the Roman camp and so
      completely surprised it that Vocula had no time to address his army or to
      form it for battle. The only precaution he could take in the general panic
      was to mass the legionaries in the centre with the auxiliaries scattered
      on either flank. Our cavalry charged, but found the enemy in good order
      ready to receive them, and came flying back on to their own infantry. What
      followed was <a name="2page137"></a><span class="pagenum">137</span>more
      of a massacre than a battle. The Nervian cohorts, either from panic or
      treachery, left our flanks exposed; thus the legions had to bear the
      brunt. They had already lost their standards and were being cut down in
      the trenches, when a fresh reinforcement suddenly changed the fortune of
      the fight. Some Basque auxiliaries,<a name="2fnm322"></a><a href="#2fn322"
      class="2fnnum">322</a> originally levied by Galba, who had now been
      summoned to the rescue, on nearing the camp heard the sound of fighting,
      and while the enemy were occupied, came charging in on their rear. This
      caused more consternation than their numbers warranted, the enemy taking
      them for the whole Roman force, either from Novaesium or from Mainz. This
      mistake encouraged the Roman troops: their confidence in others brought
      confidence in themselves. The best of the Batavians, at least of their
      infantry, fell. The cavalry made off with the standards and prisoners
      taken in the earlier stage of the battle. Though our losses that day were
      numerically larger, they were unimportant, whereas the Germans lost their
      best troops.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap34" id="IVchap34"></a><span class="chapnum">34</span>On
      both sides the generals deserved defeat, and failed to make good use of
      their success. Their fault was the same. Had Civilis furnished the
      attacking column with more troops, they could never have been surrounded
      by such a small force, and having stormed the camp would have destroyed
      it. Vocula, on the other <a name="2page138"></a><span class="pagenum">138</span>hand,
      had not even set scouts to warn him of the enemy's approach, and
      consequently no sooner sallied out than he was beaten. Then, when he had
      won the victory, he showed great lack of confidence, and wasted day after
      day before moving against the enemy. If he had made haste to follow up his
      success and struck at the enemy at once, he might have raised the siege of
      Vetera at one blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Civilis had been playing upon the feelings of the besieged by
      pretending that the Romans had been defeated and success had favoured his
      arms. The captured standards and colours were carried round the walls and
      the prisoners also displayed. One of these did a famous deed of heroism.
      Shouting at the top of his voice, he revealed the truth. The Germans at
      once struck him dead, which only served to confirm his information. Soon,
      too, the besieged saw signs of harried fields and the smoke of burning
      farms, and began to realize that a victorious army was approaching. When
      he was in sight of the camp Vocula ordered his men to plant the standards
      and construct a trench and rampart round them: they were to deposit all
      their baggage there and fight unencumbered. This made them shout at the
      general to give them the signal; and they had learnt to use threats too.
      Without even taking time to form their line they started the battle, all
      tired as they were, and in disorder. Civilis was ready waiting for them,
      trusting quite as much to their mistakes as to the merits of his own men.
      The Romans fought with varying fortune. All the most mutinous <a
      name="2page139"></a><span class="pagenum">139</span>proved cowards: some,
      however, remembered their recent victory and stuck to their places,
      cutting down the enemy, and encouraging themselves and their neighbours.
      When the battle was thus renewed, they waved their hands and signalled to
      the besieged not to lose their opportunity. These were watching all that
      happened from the walls, and now came bursting out at every gate. It
      chanced that at this point Civilis' horse fell and threw him; both armies
      believed the rumour that he had been wounded and killed. This caused
      immense consternation to his army and immense encouragement to ours.
      However, Vocula failed to pursue them when they fled, and merely set about
      strengthening the rampart and turrets, apparently in fear of another
      blockade. His frequent failure to make use of his victory gives colour to
      the suspicion that he preferred <a name="2fnm323"></a>war.<a href="#2fn323"
      class="2fnnum">323</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap35" id="IVchap35"></a><span class="chapnum">35</span>What
      chiefly distressed our troops was the lack of supplies. The baggage-train
      of the legions was sent to Novaesium with a crowd of non-combatants to
      fetch provisions thence by land, the enemy being now masters of the river.
      The first convoy got through <a name="2page140"></a><span class="pagenum">140</span>safely,
      while Civilis was recovering from his fall. But when he heard that a
      second foraging-party had been sent to Novaesium under guard of several
      cohorts, and that they were proceeding on their way with their arms piled
      in the wagons as if it was a time of perfect peace, few keeping to the
      standards and all wandering at will, he sent some men forward to hold the
      bridges and any places where the road was narrow, and then formed up and
      attacked. The battle was fought on a long straggling line, and the issue
      was still doubtful when nightfall broke it off. The cohorts made their way
      through to Gelduba, where the camp remained as it was,<a name="2fnm324"></a><a
      href="#2fn324" class="2fnnum">324</a> garrisoned by the soldiers who had
      been left behind there. It was obvious what dangers the convoy would have
      to face on the return journey; they would be heavily laden and had already
      lost their nerve. <a name="2fnm325"></a>Vocula<a href="#2fn325"
      class="2fnnum">325</a> accordingly added to his force a thousand picked
      men from the Fifth and Fifteenth legions who had been at Vetera during the
      siege, all tough soldiers with a grievance against their generals. Against
      his orders, more than the thousand started with him, openly complaining on
      the march that they would not put up with famine and the treachery of
      their generals any longer. On the other hand, those who stayed behind
      grumbled that they were left to their fate now that part of the garrison
      had been removed. Thus there was a double mutiny, one party <a
      name="2page141"></a><span class="pagenum">141</span>calling Vocula back,
      the others refusing to return to camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap36" id="IVchap36"></a><span class="chapnum">36</span>Meanwhile
      Civilis laid siege to Vetera. Vocula retired to Gelduba, and thence to
      Novaesium, shortly afterwards winning a cavalry skirmish just outside
      Novaesium. The Roman soldiers, however, alike in success and in failure,
      were as eager as ever to make an end of their generals. Now that their
      numbers were swelled by the arrival of the detachments from the Fifth and
      the <a name="2fnm326"></a>Fifteenth<a href="#2fn326" class="2fnnum">326</a>
      they demanded their donative, having learnt that money had arrived from
      Vitellius. Without further delay Flaccus gave it to them in Vespasian's
      name, and this did more than anything else to promote mutiny. They
      indulged in wild dissipation and met every night in drinking-parties, at
      which they revived their old grudge against Hordeonius Flaccus. None of
      the officers ventured to interfere with them&mdash;the darkness somehow
      obscured their sense of duty&mdash;and at last they dragged Flaccus out of
      bed and murdered him. They were preparing to do the same with Vocula, but
      he narrowly escaped in the darkness, disguised as a slave. <a
      name="IVchap37" id="IVchap37"></a><span class="chapnum">37</span>When the
      excitement subsided, their fears returned, and they sent letters round by
      centurions to all the Gallic communities, asking for reinforcements and
      money for the soldiers' pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a leader a mob is always rash, timorous, and inactive. On the
      approach of Civilis they hurriedly snatched up their arms, and then
      immediately dropped them and took to flight. Misfortune now bred disunion,
      <a name="2page142"></a><span class="pagenum">142</span>and the army of the
      Upper <a name="2fnm327"></a>Rhine<a href="#2fn327" class="2fnnum">327</a>
      dissociated itself from the rest. However, they set up the statues of
      Vitellius again in the camp and in the neighbouring Belgic villages,
      although by now Vitellius was <a name="2fnm328"></a>dead.<a href="#2fn328"
      class="2fnnum">328</a> Soon the soldiers of the First, Fourth, and
      Twenty-second repented of their folly and rejoined Vocula. He made them
      take a second oath of allegiance to Vespasian and led them off to raise
      the siege of Mainz. The besieging army, a combined force of <a
      name="2fnm329"></a>Chatti,<a href="#2fn329" class="2fnnum">329</a> Usipi,
      and <a name="2fnm330"></a>Mattiaci,<a href="#2fn330" class="2fnnum">330</a>
      had already retired, having got sufficient loot and suffered some loss.
      Our troops surprised them while they were scattered along the road, and
      immediately attacked. Moreover, the Treviri had built a rampart and
      breastwork all along their frontier and fought the Germans again and again
      with heavy loss to both sides. Before long, however, they rebelled, and
      thus sullied their great services to the Roman people.

          Mr. Henderson calls this sentence 'a veritable masterpiece of
          improbability', and finds it 'hard to speak calmly of such a
          judgement'. He has to confess that a military motive for Vocula's
          inaction is hard to find. Tacitus, feeling the same, offers a merely
          human motive. Soldiers of fortune often prefer war to final victory,
          and in these days the dangers of peace were only equalled by its
          ennui. Besides, Tacitus' explanation lends itself to an epigram which
          he would doubtless not have exchanged for the tedium of tactical
          truth.

      <a name="Under_Vespasian" id="Under_Vespasian"></a>Rome and the Empire
      under Vespasian
    </h3>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap38" id="IVchap38"></a><span class="chapnum">38</span>During
      these events Vespasian took up his second consulship and Titus his first,
      both in <a name="2fnm331"></a>absence.<a href="#2fn331" class="2fnnum">331</a>
      Rome was depressed and beset by manifold anxieties. Apart <a
      name="2page143"></a><span class="pagenum">143</span>from the real miseries
      of the moment, it was plunged into a groundless panic on the rumour of a
      rebellion in Africa, where Lucius Piso was supposed to be plotting a
      revolution. Piso, who was governor of the province, was far from being a
      firebrand. But the severity of the winter delayed the corn-ships, and the
      common people, accustomed to buy their bread day by day, whose interest in
      politics was confined to the corn-supply, soon began to believe their
      fears that the coast of Africa was being blockaded and supplies withheld.
      The Vitellians, who were still under the sway of party spirit, fostered
      this rumour, and even the victorious party were not entirely displeased at
      it, for none of their victories in the civil war had satisfied their
      greed, and even foreign wars fell far short of their ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap39" id="IVchap39"></a><span class="chapnum">39</span>On the
      first of January the senate was convened by the Urban <a name="2fnm332"></a>Praetor,<a
      href="#2fn332" class="2fnnum">332</a> Julius Frontinus, and passed votes
      of thanks and congratulation to the generals, armies, and foreign <a
      name="2fnm333"></a>princes.<a href="#2fn333" class="2fnnum">333</a>
      Tettius <a name="2fnm334"></a>Julianus,<a href="#2fn334" class="2fnnum">334</a>
      who had left his legion when it went over to Vespasian, was deprived of
      his praetorship, which was conferred upon Plotius <a name="2fnm335"></a>Grypus.<a
      href="#2fn335" class="2fnnum">335</a> <a name="2fnm336"></a>Hormus<a
      href="#2fn336" class="2fnnum">336</a> was raised to equestrian rank.
      Frontinus then resigned his praetorship and Caesar Domitian succeeded him.
      His name now stood at the head of all dispatches and edicts, but the real
      authority <a name="2page144"></a><span class="pagenum">144</span>lay with
      Mucianus, although Domitian, following the promptings of his friends and
      of his own desires, frequently asserted his independence. But Mucianus'
      chief cause of anxiety lay in Antonius Primus and Arrius Varus. The fame
      of their exploits was still fresh; the soldiers worshipped them; and they
      were popular in Rome, because they had used no violence off the field of
      battle. It was even hinted that Antonius had urged Crassus <a
      name="2fnm337"></a>Scribonianus<a href="#2fn337" class="2fnnum">337</a> to
      seize the throne. He was a man who owed his distinction to famous
      ancestors and to his brother's memory, and Antonius could promise him
      adequate support for a conspiracy. However, Scribonianus refused. He had a
      terror of all risks, and would hardly have been seduced even by the
      certainty of success. Being unable to crush Antonius openly, Mucianus
      showered compliments on him in the senate and embarrassed him with
      promises, hinting at the governorship of Nearer Spain, which the departure
      of Cluvius <a name="2fnm338"></a>Rufus<a href="#2fn338" class="2fnnum">338</a>
      had left vacant. Meanwhile he lavished military commands on Antonius'
      friends. Then, having filled his empty head with ambitious hopes, he
      destroyed his influence at one stroke by moving the Seventh <a
      name="2fnm339"></a>legion,<a href="#2fn339" class="2fnnum">339</a> which
      was passionately attached to Antonius, into winter-quarters. The Third,
      who were similarly devoted to Arrius Varus, <a name="2page145"></a><span
      class="pagenum">145</span>were sent back to <a name="2fnm340"></a>Syria,<a
      href="#2fn340" class="2fnnum">340</a> and part of the army was taken out
      to the war in Germany. Thus, on the removal of the disturbing factors, the
      city could resume its normal life under the old regime of law and civil
      government.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap40" id="IVchap40"></a><span class="chapnum">40</span>On the
      day of his first appearance in the senate Domitian spoke a few moderate
      sentences regretting the absence of his father and brother. His behaviour
      was most proper, and, as his character was still an unknown quantity, his
      blushes were taken for signs of modesty.<a name="2fnm341"></a><a
      href="#2fn341" class="2fnnum">341</a> He moved from the chair that all
      Galba's honours should be restored, to which Curtius Montanus proposed an
      amendment that some respect should also be paid to the memory of Piso. The
      senate approved both proposals, though nothing was done about Piso. Next,
      various commissions were appointed by lot to restore the spoils of war to
      the owners; to examine and affix the bronze tablets of laws, which in
      course of time had dropped off the walls; to revise the list of public
      holidays, which in these days of flattery had been disgracefully tampered
      with; and to introduce some economy into public expenditure. Tettius
      Julianus was restored to his praetorship as soon as it was discovered that
      he had taken refuge with Vespasian: but Grypus was allowed to retain his
      <a name="2fnm342"></a>rank.<a href="#2fn342" class="2fnnum">342</a> It was
      then decided to resume the hearing of the case of<a name="2page146"></a><span
      class="pagenum">146</span> Musonius Rufus against Publius <a name="2fnm343"></a>Celer<a
      href="#2fn343" class="2fnnum">343</a> Publius was convicted and the shade
      of Soranus satisfied. This strict verdict made the day memorable in the
      annals of Rome, and credit was also due to private enterprise, for
      everybody felt that Musonius had done his duty in bringing the action. On
      the other hand, Demetrius, a professor of Cynic philosophy, earned
      discredit for defending an obvious <a name="2fnm344"></a>criminal<a
      href="#2fn344" class="2fnnum">344</a> more for ostentatious motives than
      from honest conviction. As for Publius, courage and fluency alike failed
      him at the critical moment. This trial was the signal for further
      reprisals against prosecutors. Junius <a name="2fnm345"></a>Mauricus<a
      href="#2fn345" class="2fnnum">345</a> accordingly petitioned Domitian that
      the senate might be allowed access to the minutes of the imperial cabinet,
      in order to find out who had applied for leave to bring a prosecution and
      against whom. The answer was that on such a question as this the emperor
      must be consulted. <a name="IVchap41" id="IVchap41"></a><span
      class="chapnum">41</span>Accordingly, at the instigation of its leading
      members, the senate framed an oath in these words, 'I call heaven to
      witness that I have never countenanced any action prejudicial to any man's
      civil status, nor have I derived any profit or any office from the
      misfortune of any Roman citizen.' The magistrates vied with each other in
      their haste to take this oath, and the other members <a name="2page147"></a><span
      class="pagenum">147</span>did the same, when called upon to speak. Those
      who had a guilty conscience were alarmed, and managed to alter the wording
      of the oath by various devices. The house meanwhile applauded every sign
      of scruple, and protested against each case of perjury. This kind of
      informal censure fell most severely on Sariolenus Vocula, Nonius Attianus,
      and Cestius Severus, who were notorious as habitual informers under Nero.
      Against Sariolenus there was also a fresh charge of having continued his
      practices with Vitellius. The members went on shaking their fists at him
      until he left the house. They next turned on Paccius Africanus, trying to
      hound him out in the same way. He was supposed to have suggested to Nero
      the murder of the two brothers <a name="2fnm346"></a>Scribonius,<a
      href="#2fn346" class="2fnnum">346</a> who were famous for their friendship
      and their wealth. Africanus dared not admit his guilt, though he could not
      very well deny it. So he swung round on Vibius Crispus,<a name="2fnm347"></a><a
      href="#2fn347" class="2fnnum">347</a> who was pestering him with
      questions, and tried to turn the tables by implicating him in the charges
      which he could not rebut, thus shifting the odium on to his accomplice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap42" id="IVchap42"></a><span class="chapnum">42</span>On
      this occasion Vipstanus <a name="2fnm348"></a>Messala<a href="#2fn348"
      class="2fnnum">348</a> gained a great reputation, both for dutiful
      affection and for eloquence, by venturing to intercede for his brother
      Aquilius <a name="2fnm349"></a>Regulus,<a href="#2fn349" class="2fnnum">349</a>
      although he had not attained the senatorial <a name="2fnm350"></a>age.<a
      href="#2fn350" class="2fnnum">350</a> Regulus had fallen into great
      disfavour for having <a name="2page148"></a><span class="pagenum">148</span>brought
      about the ruin of the noble families of the Crassi and of Orfitus. It was
      supposed that, though quite a young man, he had voluntarily undertaken the
      prosecution, not to escape any danger which was threatening him, but from
      purely ambitious motives. Crassus' wife, Sulpicia Praetextata, and his
      four sons were anxious to secure revenge if the senate would grant a
      trial. Messala therefore made no attempt to defend the case or the
      accused, but tried to shelter his brother, and had already won over some
      of the senators. Curtius Montanus now attacked him in a savage speech, and
      even went so far as to charge Regulus with having given money to Piso's
      murderer after Galba's death, and with having bitten Piso's <a
      name="2fnm351"></a>head.<a href="#2fn351" class="2fnnum">351</a> 'That,'
      said he, 'Nero certainly did not compel you to do. You purchased neither
      position nor safety by that savage piece of cruelty. We may put up with
      the pleas of those wretches who prefer to ruin others rather than endanger
      their own lives. But your father's banishment had guaranteed your
      security. His property had been divided amongst his <a name="2fnm352"></a>creditors.<a
      href="#2fn352" class="2fnnum">352</a> You were not of an age to stand for
      office. Nero had nothing either to hope or to fear from you. Your talents
      were as yet untried and you had never exerted them in any man's defence,
      yet your lust for blood, your insatiable ambition, led you to stain your
      young hands in the blood of Rome's nobility. At one swoop <a
      name="2page149"></a><span class="pagenum">149</span>you caused the ruin of
      innocent youths, of old and distinguished statesmen, of high-born ladies;
      and out of the country's disaster you secured for yourself the spoils of
      two ex-consuls,<a name="2fnm353"></a><a href="#2fn353" class="2fnnum">353</a>
      stuffed seven million sesterces into your purse, and shone with the
      reflected glory of a priesthood. You would blame Nero's lack of enterprise
      because he took one household at a time, thus causing unnecessary fatigue
      to himself and his informers, when he might have ruined the whole senate
      at a single word. Why, gentlemen, you must indeed keep and preserve to
      yourselves a counsellor of such ready resource. Let each generation have
      its good examples: and as our old men follow Eprius Marcellus or Vibius
      Crispus, let the rising generation emulate Regulus. Villainy finds
      followers even when it fails. What if it flourish and prosper? If we
      hesitate to touch a mere ex-quaestor, shall we be any bolder when he has
      been praetor and consul? Or do you suppose that the race of tyrants came
      to an end in Nero? That is what the people believed who outlived Tiberius
      or Caligula, and meanwhile there arose one more infamous and more bloody
      <a name="2fnm354"></a>still.<a href="#2fn354" class="2fnnum">354</a> We
      are not afraid of Vespasian. We trust his years and his natural
      moderation. But a good precedent outlives a good sovereign. Gentlemen, we
      are growing effete: we are no longer that senate which, after Nero had
      been killed, clamoured for the punishment of all informers and their
      menials according to our ancestors'<a name="2page150"></a><span
      class="pagenum">150</span> rigorous prescription. The best chance comes on
      the day after the death of a bad emperor.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap43" id="IVchap43"></a><span class="chapnum">43</span>The
      senate listened to Montanus's speech with such sympathy that Helvidius
      began to hope that it might be possible to get a verdict even against
      Marcellus. Beginning with a eulogy of Cluvius Rufus, who, though quite as
      rich and as eloquent as Marcellus, had never brought any one into trouble
      under Nero, he went on to attack Marcellus, both by contrasting him with
      Rufus and by pressing home the charge against him. Feeling that the house
      was warming to this rhetoric, Marcellus got up as though to leave,
      exclaiming, 'I am off, Helvidius: I leave you your senate: you can
      tyrannize over it under Caesar's nose.' Vibius Crispus followed Marcellus,
      and, though both were angry, their expressions were very different.
      Marcellus marched out with flashing eyes, Crispus with a smile on his
      face. Eventually their friends went and brought them back. Thus the
      struggle grew more and more heated between a well-meaning majority and a
      small but powerful minority; and since they were both animated by
      irreconcilable hatred, the day was spent in vain recriminations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap44" id="IVchap44"></a><span class="chapnum">44</span>At the
      next sitting Domitian opened by recommending them to forget their
      grievances and grudges and the unavoidable exigences of the recent past.
      Mucianus then at great length moved a motion in favour of the prosecutors,
      issuing a mild warning, almost in terms of entreaty, to those who wanted
      to revive actions which had been begun and dropped.<a name="2page151"></a><span
      class="pagenum">151</span> Seeing that their attempt at independence was
      being thwarted, the senate gave it up. However, that it might not seem as
      if the senate's opinion had been flouted and complete impunity granted for
      all crimes committed under Nero, Mucianus forced Octavius Sagitta and
      Antistius Sosianus, who had returned from exile, to go back to the islands
      to which they had been confined. Octavius had committed adultery with
      Pontia Postumina, and, on her refusal to marry him, had murdered her in a
      fit of jealous fury. Sosianus was an unprincipled scoundrel who had been
      the ruin of <a name="2fnm355"></a>many.<a href="#2fn355" class="2fnnum">355</a>
      The senate had found them both guilty, and passed a heavy sentence of
      exile, nor had their penalty been remitted, although others were allowed
      to return. However, this failed to allay the ill-feeling against Mucianus,
      for Sosianus and Sagitta, whether they returned or not, were of no
      importance, whereas people were afraid of the professional prosecutors,
      who were men of wealth and ability and experts in crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap45" id="IVchap45"></a><span class="chapnum">45</span>Unanimity
      was gradually restored in the senate by the holding of a trial according
      to ancient precedent, before a court of the whole house. A senator named
      Manlius Patruitus complained that he had been beaten before a mob of
      people in the colony of Siena by order of the local magistrates. Nor had
      the affront stopped there. They had held a mock funeral before his eyes,
      and had accompanied their dirges and lamentations with gross insults
      levelled at the whole senate. The <a name="2page152"></a><span
      class="pagenum">152</span>accused were summoned; their case was tried;
      they were convicted and punished. A further decree of the senate was
      passed admonishing the commons of Siena to pay more respect to the laws.
      About the same time Antonius Flamma was prosecuted by Cyrene for
      extortion, and exiled for the inhumanity of his conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap46" id="IVchap46"></a><span class="chapnum">46</span>Meanwhile,
      a mutiny almost broke out among the soldiers. The men who had been
      discharged by <a name="2fnm356"></a>Vitellius<a href="#2fn356"
      class="2fnnum">356</a> came together again in support of Vespasian, and
      demanded re-admission. They were joined by the selected legionaries who
      had also been led to hope for service in the Guards, and they now demanded
      the pay they had been promised. Even the <a name="2fnm357"></a>Vitellians<a
      href="#2fn357" class="2fnnum">357</a> alone could not have been dispersed
      without serious bloodshed, but it would require immense sums of money to
      retain the services of such a large number of men. Mucianus accordingly
      entered the barracks to make a careful estimate of each man's term of
      service. He formed up the victorious troops with their own arms and
      distinctive decorations, each company a few paces from the next. Then the
      Vitellians who had surrendered, as we have described, at <a name="2fnm358"></a>Bovillae,<a
      href="#2fn358" class="2fnnum">358</a> and all the other soldiers who had
      been hunted down in the city and its neighbourhood, were marched out
      almost entirely without arms or uniforms. Mucianus then had them <a
      name="2page153"></a><span class="pagenum">153</span>sorted out, and drew
      up in separate corps the troops of the German army, of the British army,
      and of any others that were in Rome. Their first glance at the scene
      astounded them. Facing them they saw what looked like a fighting front
      bristling with weapons, while they were caught in a trap, defenceless and
      foul with dirt. As soon as they began to be sorted out a panic seized
      them. The German troops in particular were terrified at their isolation,
      and felt they were being told off for slaughter. They embraced their
      comrades and clung upon their necks, asking for one last kiss, begging not
      to be left alone, crying out, 'Our cause is the same as yours, why should
      our fate be different?' They appealed now to Mucianus, now to the absent
      emperor, and lastly to the powers of Heaven, until Mucianus came to the
      rescue of their imaginary terrors by calling them all 'sworn servants of
      one emperor', for he found that the victorious army was joining in and
      seconding their tears with cheering. On that day the matter ended there. A
      few days later, when Domitian addressed them, they received him with
      renewed confidence, refused his offer of lands, and begged for enlistment
      and their pay instead. This was only a petition, but one that could not be
      refused: so they were admitted to the Guards. Subsequently, those who had
      grown old and completed the regular term of <a name="2fnm359"></a>service<a
      href="#2fn359" class="2fnnum">359</a> were honourably discharged. Others
      were dismissed for misbehaviour, but one by one at <a name="2page154"></a><span
      class="pagenum">154</span>different times, which is always the safest
      method of weakening any kind of conspiracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap47" id="IVchap47"></a><span class="chapnum">47</span>To
      return to the senate; a bill was now passed that a loan of sixty million
      sesterces should be raised from private individuals and administered by
      Pompeius Silvanus. This may have been a financial necessity, or they may
      have wanted it to seem so. At any rate the necessity soon ceased to exist,
      or else they gave up the pretence. Domitian then carried a proposal that
      the consulships conferred by Vitellius should be cancelled, and that a
      state funeral should be held in honour of Flavius <a name="2fnm360"></a>Sabinus.<a
      href="#2fn360" class="2fnnum">360</a> Both proposals are striking evidence
      of the fickleness of human fortune, which so often makes the first last
      and the last first.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap48" id="IVchap48"></a><span class="chapnum">48</span>It was
      about this time that Lucius <a name="2fnm361"></a>Piso,<a href="#2fn361"
      class="2fnnum">361</a> the pro-consul of Africa, was killed. To give a
      true explanation of this murder we must go back and take a brief survey of
      certain matters which are closely connected with the reasons for such
      crimes. Under the sainted Augustus and Tiberius the pro-consul of Africa
      had in his command one legion and some auxiliaries with which to guard the
      frontier of the <a name="2fnm362"></a>empire.<a href="#2fn362"
      class="2fnnum">362</a> Caligula, who was restless by nature and harboured
      suspicions <a name="2page155"></a><span class="pagenum">155</span>of the
      then pro-consul, Marcus Silanus, withdrew the legion from his command and
      put it under a legate whom he sent out for the purpose. As each had an
      equal amount of patronage and their functions overlapped, Caligula thus
      caused a state of friction which was further aggravated by regrettable
      quarrels. The greater permanence of his <a name="2fnm363"></a>tenure<a
      href="#2fn363" class="2fnnum">363</a> gradually strengthened the legate's
      position, and perhaps an inferior is always anxious to vie with his
      betters. The most eminent governors, on the other hand, were more careful
      of their comfort than of their authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap49" id="IVchap49"></a><span class="chapnum">49</span>At the
      present time the legion in Africa was commanded by Valerius <a
      name="2fnm364"></a>Festus,<a href="#2fn364" class="2fnnum">364</a> an
      extravagant young man, immoderately ambitious, whose kinship with
      Vitellius had given him some anxiety. He had frequent interviews with
      Piso, and it is impossible to tell whether he tempted Piso to rebel or
      resisted Piso's temptations. No one was present at their interviews, which
      were held in private, and after Piso's death most people were inclined to
      sympathize with his murderer. Beyond doubt the province and the garrison
      were unfavourable to Vespasian. Besides, some of the Vitellian refugees
      from Rome pointed out to Piso that the Gallic provinces were wavering.
      Germany was ready to rebel, and he himself was in danger; 'and,' they
      added, 'if you earn suspicion in peace your safest <a name="2page156"></a><span
      class="pagenum">156</span>course is war.' Meanwhile, Claudius Sagitta, who
      commanded Petra's Horse,<a name="2fnm365"></a><a href="#2fn365"
      class="2fnnum">365</a> made a good crossing and outstripped the centurion
      Papirius, who had been sent out by Mucianus and was commissioned, so
      Sagitta affirmed, to assassinate Piso. Sagitta further stated that
      Galerianus,<a name="2fnm366"></a><a href="#2fn366" class="2fnnum">366</a>
      Piso's cousin and son-in-law, had already been murdered, and told him that
      while his one hope lay in taking a bold step, there were two courses open
      to him: he might either take up arms on the spot, or he might prefer to
      sail to Gaul and offer to lead the Vitellian armies. This made no
      impression on Piso. When the centurion whom Mucianus had sent arrived at
      the gates of Carthage, he kept on shouting all sorts of congratulations to
      Piso on becoming emperor. The people he met, who were astounded at this
      unexpected miracle, were instructed to take up the cry. With a crowd's
      usual credulity, they rushed into the forum calling on Piso to appear, and
      as they had a passion for flattery and took no interest in the truth, they
      proceeded to fill the whole place with a confused noise of cheering. Piso,
      however, either at a hint from Sagitta, or from his natural good sense,
      would not show himself in public or give way to the excitement of the
      crowd. He examined the centurion, and learnt that his object was to trump
      up a charge against him and then kill <a name="2fnm367"></a>him.<a
      href="#2fn367" class="2fnnum">367</a> He accordingly had the man executed
      more from indignation against <a name="2page157"></a><span class="pagenum">157</span>the
      assassin than in any hope of saving his life; for he found that the man
      had been one of the murderers of Clodius <a name="2fnm368"></a>Macer,<a
      href="#2fn368" class="2fnnum">368</a> and after staining his hand in the
      blood of a military officer was now proposing to turn it against a civil
      governor. Piso then reprimanded the Carthaginians in an edict which
      clearly showed his anxiety, and refrained from performing even the routine
      of his office, shutting himself up in his house, for fear that he might by
      accident provide some pretext for further demonstrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap50" id="IVchap50"></a><span class="chapnum">50</span>When
      the news of the popular excitement and the centurion's execution reached
      the ears of Festus, considerably exaggerated and with the usual admixture
      of falsehood, he at once sent off a party of horsemen to murder Piso.
      Riding at full speed, they reached the governor's house in the twilight of
      early dawn and broke in with drawn swords. As Festus had mainly chosen
      Carthaginian auxiliaries and Moors to do the murder, most of them did not
      know Piso by sight. However, near his bedroom they happened on a slave and
      asked him where Piso was and what he looked like. In answer the slave told
      them a heroic lie and said he was Piso, whereupon they immediately cut him
      down. However, Piso himself was killed very soon after, for there was one
      man among them who knew him, and that was Baebius Massa, one of the
      imperial agents in Africa, who was already a danger to all the best men in
      Rome. His name will recur again and again in this narrative, as one of the
      causes of the troubles <a name="2page158"></a><span class="pagenum">158</span>which
      beset us later <a name="2fnm369"></a>on.<a href="#2fn369" class="2fnnum">369</a>
      Festus had been waiting at <a name="2fnm370"></a>Adrumetum<a href="#2fn370"
      class="2fnnum">370</a> to see how things went, and he now hastened to
      rejoin his legion. He had the camp-prefect, Caetronius Pisanus, put in
      irons, alleging that he was one of Piso's accomplices, though his real
      motive was personal dislike. He then punished some of the soldiers and
      centurions and rewarded others; in neither case for their deserts, but
      because he wanted it to be thought that he had stamped out a war. His next
      task was to settle the differences between Oea and Lepcis.<a name="2fnm371"></a><a
      href="#2fn371" class="2fnnum">371</a> These had had a trivial origin in
      thefts of fruit and cattle by the peasants, but they were now trying to
      settle them in open warfare. Oea, being inferior in numbers, had called in
      the aid of the <a name="2fnm372"></a>Garamantes,<a href="#2fn372"
      class="2fnnum">372</a> an invincible tribe, who were always a fruitful
      source of damage to their neighbours. Thus the people of Lepcis were in
      great straits. Their fields had been wasted far and wide, and they had
      fled in terror under shelter of their walls, when the Roman auxiliaries,
      both horse and foot, arrived on the scene. They routed the Garamantes and
      recovered all the booty, except what the nomads had already sold among the
      inaccessible hut-settlements of the far interior.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap51" id="IVchap51"></a><span class="chapnum">51</span>After
      the battle of Cremona and the arrival of good <a name="2page159"></a><span
      class="pagenum">159</span>news from every quarter, Vespasian now heard of
      Vitellius' death. A large number of people of all classes, who were as
      lucky as they were adventurous, successfully braved the winter seas on
      purpose to bring him the <a name="2fnm373"></a>news.<a href="#2fn373"
      class="2fnnum">373</a> There also arrived envoys from King Vologaesus
      offering the services of forty thousand Parthian <a name="2fnm374"></a>cavalry.<a
      href="#2fn374" class="2fnnum">374</a> It was, indeed, a proud and
      fortunate situation to be courted with such splendid offers of assistance,
      and to need none of them. Vologaesus was duly thanked and instructed to
      send his envoys to the senate and to understand that peace had been made.
      Vespasian now devoted his attention to the affairs of Italy and the
      Capitol, and received an unfavourable report of Domitian, who seemed to be
      trespassing beyond the natural sphere of an emperor's youthful son. He
      accordingly handed over the flower of his army to Titus, who was to finish
      off the war with the <a name="2fnm375"></a>Jews.<a href="#2fn375"
      class="2fnnum">375</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap52" id="IVchap52"></a><span class="chapnum">52</span>It is
      said that before his departure Titus had a long talk with his father and
      begged him not to be rash and lose his temper at these incriminating
      reports, but to meet his son in a forgiving and unprejudiced spirit,
      'Neither legions nor fleets,' he is reported to have said, 'are such sure
      bulwarks of the throne as a number of children. Time, chance and often,
      too, ambition and misunderstanding weaken, alienate or extinguish
      friendship: a man's own blood cannot be severed from him; and above all is
      this the case with <a name="2page160"></a><span class="pagenum">160</span>a
      sovereign, for, while others enjoy his good fortune, his misfortunes only
      concern his nearest kin. Nor again are brothers likely to remain good
      friends unless their father sets them an example.' These words had the
      effect of making Vespasian rather delighted at Titus' goodness of heart
      than inclined to forgive Domitian. 'You may ease your mind,' he said to
      Titus, 'It is now your duty to increase the prestige of Rome on the field:
      I will concern myself with peace at home.' Though the weather was still
      very rough, Vespasian at once launched his fastest corn-ships with a full
      cargo. For the city was on the verge of <a name="2fnm376"></a>famine.<a
      href="#2fn376" class="2fnnum">376</a> Indeed, there were not supplies for
      more than ten days in the public granaries at the moment when Vespasian's
      convoy brought relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap53" id="IVchap53"></a><span class="chapnum">53</span>The
      task of restoring the <a name="2fnm377"></a>Capitol<a href="#2fn377"
      class="2fnnum">377</a> was entrusted to Lucius Vestinus, who, though only
      a knight, yet in reputation and influence could rank with the highest. He
      summoned all the soothsayers,<a name="2fnm378"></a><a href="#2fn378"
      class="2fnnum">378</a> and they recommended that the ruins of the former
      temple should be carried away to the <a name="2fnm379"></a>marshes<a
      href="#2fn379" class="2fnnum">379</a> and a new temple erected on the same
      site: the gods were unwilling, they said, that the original form of the
      building should be changed. On the 21st of June, a day of bright sun<a
      name="2page161"></a><span class="pagenum">161</span>shine, the whole
      consecrated area of the temple was decorated with chaplets and garlands.
      In marched soldiers, all men with names of good omen, carrying branches of
      lucky trees:<a name="2fnm380"></a><a href="#2fn380" class="2fnnum">380</a>
      then came the Vestal Virgins accompanied by boys and girls, each of whom
      had father and mother <a name="2fnm381"></a>alive,<a href="#2fn381"
      class="2fnnum">381</a> and they cleansed it all by sprinkling fresh water
      from a spring or river.<a name="2fnm382"></a><a href="#2fn382"
      class="2fnnum">382</a> Next, while the high priest, Plautius Aelianus,
      dictated the proper formulae, Helvidius Priscus, the praetor, first
      consecrated the site by a solemn <a name="2fnm383"></a>sacrifice<a
      href="#2fn383" class="2fnnum">383</a> of a pig, a sheep and an ox, and
      then duly offering the entrails on an altar of turf, he prayed to Jupiter,
      Juno, and Minerva, as the guardian deities of the empire, to prosper the
      enterprise, and by divine grace to bring to completion this house of
      theirs which human piety had here begun. He then took hold of the chaplets
      to which the ropes holding the foundation-stone were attached. At the same
      moment the other magistrates and the priests and senators and knights and
      large numbers of the populace in joyous excitement with one great effort
      dragged the huge stone into its place. On every side gifts of gold and
      silver were flung into the foundations, and <a name="2page162"></a><span
      class="pagenum">162</span>blocks of virgin ore unscathed by any furnace,
      just as they had come from the womb of the earth. For the soothsayers had
      given out that the building must not be desecrated by the use of stone or
      gold that had been put to any other purpose. The height of the roof was
      raised. This was the only change that religious scruples would allow, and
      it was felt to be the only point in which the former temple lacked
      grandeur.

          Africa was peculiar in that the pro-consul, who governed it for the
          senate, commanded an army. All the other provinces demanding military
          protection were under imperial control. Caligula, without withdrawing
          the province from the senate, in some degree regularized the anomaly
          by transferring this command to a 'legate' of his own, technically
          inferior to the civil governor.

      Vitellius' death had spread through Gaul and Germany and redoubled the
      vigour of the war. Civilis now dropped all pretence and hurled himself
      upon the Roman Empire. The Vitellian legions felt that even foreign
      slavery was preferable to owning Vespasian's sovereignty. The Gauls too
      had taken heart. A rumour had been spread that our winter camps in Moesia
      and Pannonia were being blockaded by Sarmatians and Dacians:<a
      name="2fnm385"></a><a href="#2fn385" class="2fnnum">385</a> similar
      stories were fabricated about Britain: the Gauls began to think that the
      fortune of the Roman arms was the same all the world over. But above all,
      the burning of the Capitol led them to believe that the empire was coming
      to an end. 'Once in old days the Gauls had captured Rome, but her empire
      had stood firm since Jupiter's high-place was left unscathed. But now,
      <a name="2page163"></a><span class="pagenum">163</span>so the <a
      name="2fnm386"></a>Druids<a href="#2fn386" class="2fnnum">386</a> with
      superstitious folly kept dinning into their ears, this fatal fire was a
      sign of Heaven's anger, and meant that the Transalpine tribes were
      destined now to rule the world.' It was also persistently rumoured that
      the Gallic chieftains, whom Otho had sent to work against <a name="2fnm387"></a>Vitellius,<a
      href="#2fn387" class="2fnnum">387</a> had agreed, before they parted, that
      if Rome sank under its internal troubles in an unbroken sequence of civil
      wars, they would not fail the cause of the Gallic freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap55" id="IVchap55"></a><span class="chapnum">55</span>Previous
      to the murder of Hordeonius <a name="2fnm388"></a>Flaccus<a href="#2fn388"
      class="2fnnum">388</a> nothing had leaked out to arouse suspicions of a
      conspiracy, but when he had been assassinated, negotiations passed between
      Civilis and Classicus,<a name="2fnm389"></a><a href="#2fn389"
      class="2fnnum">389</a> who commanded the Treviran cavalry. Classicus was
      far above the rest both in birth and in wealth. He came of royal line and
      his stock was famous both in peace and war. It was his boast that his
      family had given Rome more enemies than allies. These two were now joined
      by Julius Tutor and Julius Sabinus, the one a Treviran, the other a
      Lingonian. Tutor had been appointed by Vitellius to watch the bank of the
      <a name="2fnm390"></a>Rhine.<a href="#2fn390" class="2fnnum">390</a>
      Sabinus'<a name="2page164"></a><span class="pagenum">164</span> natural
      vanity was further inflamed by spurious pretensions of high birth, for he
      alleged that his great-grandmother's beauty had caught the fancy of Julius
      Caesar during the campaign in Gaul, and that they had committed adultery.
      These four tested the temper of the rest in private interviews, and having
      bound to the conspiracy those who were considered fit, they held a
      conference at Cologne in a private house, the general feeling in the city
      being hostile to such plans as theirs. A few of the Ubii and Tungri,
      indeed, attended, but the Treviri and Lingonians were the backbone of the
      conspiracy. Nor would they tolerate deliberation or delay. They vied with
      each other in protesting that Rome was distracted by internal quarrels;
      legions had been cut to pieces, Italy devastated, the city was on the
      point of being taken, while all her armies were occupied with wars of
      their own in different quarters. They need only garrison the Alps and
      then, when liberty had taken firm root, they could discuss together what
      limit each tribe should set to its exercise of power.

      this was no sooner spoken than applauded. About the remnant of Vitellius'
      army they were in some doubt. Many held that they ought to be killed as
      being treacherous and insubordinate and stained with the blood of their
      generals. However, the idea of sparing them carried the day. To destroy
      all hope of pardon would only steel their obstinacy: it was much better to
      seduce them into alliance: only the generals need be killed; a guilty
      conscience and the hope of pardon would soon bring the rest flocking over
      <a name="2page165"></a><span class="pagenum">165</span>to their flag. Such
      was the tenor of their first meeting. Agitators were sent all over Gaul to
      stir up war. The conspirators themselves feigned loyalty to Vocula, hoping
      to catch him off his <a name="2fnm391"></a>guard.<a href="#2fn391"
      class="2fnnum">391</a> There were, indeed, traitors who reported all this
      to Vocula, but he was not strong enough to crush the conspiracy, his
      legions being short-handed and unreliable. Between suspected troops on one
      side and secret enemies on the other, it seemed his best course under the
      circumstances to dissemble, as they were doing, and thus use their own
      weapons against them. So he marched down the river to Cologne. There he
      found Claudius Labeo, who after being taken prisoner, as described <a
      name="2fnm392"></a>above,<a href="#2fn392" class="2fnnum">392</a> and
      relegated to the Frisii, had bribed his guards and escaped to Cologne. He
      promised that if Vocula would provide him with troops, he would go to the
      Batavi and win back the better part of their community to the Roman
      alliance. He was given a small force of horse and foot. Without venturing
      any attempt upon the Batavi, he attracted a few of the Nervii and <a
      name="2fnm393"></a>Baetasii<a href="#2fn393" class="2fnnum">393</a> to his
      standard, and proceeded to harass the Canninefates and Marsaci<a

      href="#2fn395" class="2fnnum">395</a> on a pretext of scouting, <a
      name="2page166"></a><span class="pagenum">166</span>and ratified their
      compact with the German leaders. They were now for the first time
      separated from the legions, and entrenched themselves in a camp of their
      own. At this, Vocula loudly protested that Rome was not as yet so
      shattered by civil war as to earn the contempt of tribes like the Treviri
      and Lingones. She could still rely on loyal provinces and victorious
      armies, on the good fortune of the empire and the avenging hand of God.
      Thus it was that in former days Sacrovir and the <a name="2fnm396"></a>Aedui,<a
      href="#2fn396" class="2fnnum">396</a> more lately and the Gallic provinces
      had each been crushed at a single battle. Now, again, these
      treaty-breakers must expect to face the same powers of Providence and
      Destiny. The sainted Julius and the sainted Augustus had understood these
      people better: it was Galba's reduction of the <a name="2fnm397"></a>tribute<a
      href="#2fn397" class="2fnnum">397</a> that had clothed them in enmity and
      pride. 'They are our enemies to-day because their yoke is easy: when they
      have been stripped and plundered they will be our friends.' After these
      spirited words, seeing that Classicus and Tutor still persisted in their
      treachery, he turned back and retired to Novaesium, while the Gauls
      encamped a couple of miles away. Thither the centurions and soldiers
      flocked to sell their souls. This was, indeed, an unheard <a
      name="2page167"></a><span class="pagenum">167</span>of villainy that Roman
      soldiers should swear allegiance to a foreign power, and offer as a pledge
      for this heinous crime either to kill or imprison their generals. Though
      many urged Vocula to escape, he felt that he must make a bold stand, so he
      summoned a meeting and spoke <a name="IVchap58" id="IVchap58"></a><span
      class="chapnum">58</span>somewhat as follows:&mdash;'Never before have I
      addressed you with such feelings of anxiety for you, or with such
      indifference to my own fate. That plans are being laid for my destruction
      I am glad enough to hear: in such a parlous case as this I look for death
      as the end of all my troubles. It is for you that I feel shame and pity.
      It is not that a field of battle awaits you, for that would only accord
      with the laws of warfare and the just rights of combatants, but because
      Classicus hopes that with your hands he can make war upon the Roman
      people, and flourishes before you an oath of allegiance to the Empire of
      All Gaul. What though fortune and courage have deserted us for the moment,
      have we not glorious examples in the past? How often have not Roman
      soldiers chosen to die rather than be driven from their post? Often have
      our allies endured the destruction of their cities and given themselves
      and their wives and children to the flames, without any other reward for
      such an end save the name of honourable men. At this very moment Roman
      troops are enduring famine and siege at Vetera, and neither threats nor
      promises can move them, while we, besides arms and men and fine
      fortifications, have supplies enough to last through any length of war.
      Money, too&mdash;the other day there was enough even <a name="2page168"></a><span
      class="pagenum">168</span>for a donative, and whether you choose to say
      that it was given you by Vespasian or by Vitellius, at any rate you got it
      from a Roman Emperor. After all the engagements you have won, after
      routing the enemy at Gelduba, at Vetera, it would be shameful enough to
      shirk battle, but you have your trenches and your walls, and there are
      ways of gaining time until armies come flocking from the neighbouring
      provinces to your rescue. Granted that you dislike me; well, there are
      others to lead you, whether legate, tribune, centurion, and even private
      soldier. But do not let this portent be trumpeted over the whole world,
      that Civilis and Classicus are going to invade Italy with you in their
      train. Suppose the Germans and Gauls lead the way to the walls of Rome,
      will you turn your arms upon your fatherland? The mere thought of such a
      crime is horrible. Will you stand sentry for the Treviran Tutor? Shall a
      Batavian give you the signal for battle? Will you swell the ranks of
      German hordes? And what will be the issue of your crime, when the Roman
      legions take the field against you? Desertion upon desertion, treachery
      upon treachery! You will be drifting miserably between the old allegiance
      and the new, with the curse of Heaven on your heads. Almighty Jupiter,
      whom we have worshipped at triumph after triumph for eight hundred and
      twenty years; and Quirinus, Father of our Rome, if it be not your pleasure
      that under my command this camp be kept clean from the stain of dishonour,
      grant at the least, I humbly beseech ye, that it never be defiled with
      <a name="2page169"></a><span class="pagenum">169</span>the pollution of a
      Tutor or a Classicus; and to these soldiers of Rome give either innocence
      of heart or a speedy repentance before the harm is done.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap59" id="IVchap59"></a><span class="chapnum">59</span>The
      speech was variously received, with feelings fluctuating between hope,
      fear, and shame. Vocula withdrew and began to prepare for his end, but his
      freedmen and slaves prevented him from forestalling by his own hand a
      dreadful death. As it was, Classicus dispatched Aemilius Longinus, a
      deserter from the First legion, who quickly murdered him. For Herennius
      and Numisius imprisonment was thought sufficient. Classicus then assumed
      the uniform and insignia of a Roman general, and thus entered the camp.
      Hardened though he was to every kind of crime, words failed him,<a
      name="2fnm398"></a><a href="#2fn398" class="2fnnum">398</a> and he could
      only read out the oath. Those who were present swore allegiance to the
      Empire of All Gaul. He then gave high promotion to Vocula's assassin, and
      rewarded the others each according to the villainy of his service.
    </p>
    <p>
      The command was now divided between Tutor and Classicus. Tutor at the head
      of a strong force besieged Cologne and forced the inhabitants and all the
      soldiers on the Upper Rhine to take the same oath of allegiance. At Mainz
      he killed the officers and drove away the camp-prefect, who had refused to
      swear. Classicus ordered all the greatest scoundrels among the deserters
      to go to Vetera and offer pardon to the besieged if they would yield to
      circumstances: otherwise there was no hope for them: they should suffer
      famine and sword <a name="2page170"></a><span class="pagenum">170</span>and
      every extremity. The messengers further cited their own example.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap60" id="IVchap60"></a><span class="chapnum">60</span>Torn
      by a conflict of loyalty and hunger, the besieged vacillated between
      honour and disgrace. While they hesitated, all their sources of food, both
      usual and unusual, began to fail them. They had eaten their mules and
      horses and all the other animals which, though foul and unclean, their
      straits had forced into use. At last they took to grubbing up the shrubs
      and roots and the grass that grew between the stones, and became a very
      pattern of endurance in wretchedness, until at last they soiled their
      glory by a shameful end. Envoys were sent to Civilis begging him to save
      their lives. Even then he refused to receive their petition until they had
      sworn allegiance to All Gaul. He then negotiated for the plunder of the
      camp and sent guards, some to secure the money, servants and baggage, and
      others to conduct the men themselves out of the camp with empty hands.
      About five miles down the road their line was surprised by an ambush of
      Germans. The bravest fell on the spot; many were cut down in flight; the
      rest got back to camp. Civilis, indeed, complained that the Germans had
      criminally broken faith and rebuked them for it. There is no evidence to
      show whether this was a pretence or whether he was really unable to
      restrain his savage troops. The camp was plundered and burnt, and all who
      had survived the battle were devoured by the flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap61" id="IVchap61"></a><span class="chapnum">61</span>When
      Civilis first took up arms against Rome he made a vow, such as is common
      with barbarians, to <a name="2page171"></a><span class="pagenum">171</span>let
      his ruddled <a name="2fnm399"></a>hair<a href="#2fn399" class="2fnnum">399</a>
      grow wild; now that he had at last accomplished the destruction of the
      legions he had it cut. It is said also that he put up some of the
      prisoners for his little son to shoot in sport with javelins and arrows.
      However that may be, he did not himself swear allegiance to All Gaul, nor
      did he force any of the Batavi to do so. He felt that he could rely on the
      strength of the Germans, and that if any quarrel arose with the Gauls
      about the empire, his fame would give him an advantage. Munius Lupercus,
      one of the Roman commanding-officers, was sent among other presents to
      Veleda, a virgin of the Bructeran tribe who wielded a wide-spread
      authority.<a name="2fnm400"></a><a href="#2fn400" class="2fnnum">400</a>
      It is an ancient custom in Germany to credit a number of women with
      prophetic powers, and with the growth of superstition these develop into
      goddesses. At this moment Veleda's influence was at its height, for she
      had prophesied the success of the Germans and the destruction of the Roman
      <a name="2fnm401"></a>army.<a href="#2fn401" class="2fnnum">401</a>
      However, Lupercus was killed on the journey. A few of the centurions and
      officers who had been born in Gaul were detained as a security for good
      faith. The winter camps of the legions and of the auxiliary infantry and
      cavalry were all dismantled and burnt, with the sole exception of those at
      Mainz and <a name="2fnm402"></a>Vindonissa.<a href="#2fn402" class="2fnnum">402</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="2page172"></a><span class="pagenum">172</span><a name="IVchap62"
      id="IVchap62"></a><span class="chapnum">62</span>The Sixteenth legion and
      the auxiliary troops who had surrendered with it now received orders to
      migrate from their quarters at Novaesium to Trier, and a date was fixed by
      which they had to leave their camp. They spent the meantime brooding on
      various anxieties, the cowards all shuddering at the precedent of the
      massacre at Vetera, the better sort covered with shame at their disgrace.
      'What sort of a march would this be? Whom would they have to lead them?
      Everything would be decided by the will of those into whose hands they had
      put their lives.' Others, again, were quite indifferent to the disgrace,
      and simply stowed all their money and most cherished possessions about
      their persons, while many got their armour ready and buckled on their
      swords, as if for battle. While they were still busy with these
      preparations the hour struck for their departure, and it proved more
      bitter than they had expected. Inside the trenches their disgrace was not
      so noticeable. The open country and the light of day revealed their depth
      of shame. The emperors' medallions had been torn <a name="2fnm403"></a>down<a
      href="#2fn403" class="2fnnum">403</a> and their standards desecrated,
      while Gallic ensigns glittered all around them. They marched in silence,
      like a long funeral procession, led by Claudius Sanctus,<a name="2fnm404"></a><a
      href="#2fn404" class="2fnnum">404</a> a man whose sinister appearance&mdash;he
      had lost one eye&mdash;was only surpassed by his weakness of intellect.
      Their disgrace was doubled when they were joined by the First legion, who
      had left their camp at<a name="2page173"></a><span class="pagenum">173</span>
      Bonn. The famous news of their capture had spread, and all the people who
      shortly before had trembled at the very name of Rome, now came flocking
      out from fields and houses, and scattered far and wide in transports of
      joy at this unwonted sight. Their insulting glee was too much for 'The
      Picenum Horse'.<a name="2fnm405"></a><a href="#2fn405" class="2fnnum">405</a>
      Defying all Sanctus' threats and promises, they turned off to Mainz, and
      coming by chance upon Longinus, the man who killed Vocula, they slew him
      with a shower of javelins and thus made a beginning of future amends. The
      legions, without changing their route, came and camped before the walls of
      Trier.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap63" id="IVchap63"></a><span class="chapnum">63</span>Highly
      elated by their success, Civilis and Classicus debated whether they should
      allow their troops to sack Cologne. Their natural savagery and lust for
      plunder inclined them to destroy the town, but policy forbade; and they
      felt that in inaugurating a new empire a reputation for clemency would be
      an asset. Civilis was also moved by the memory of a past service, for at
      the beginning of the outbreak his son had been arrested in Cologne, and
      they had kept him in honourable custody. However, the tribes across the
      Rhine were jealous of this rich and rising community, and held that the
      war could only be ended either by throwing the settlement open to all
      Germans without distinction or by destroying it and thereby dispersing<a
      name="2page174"></a><span class="pagenum">174</span> <a name="IVchap64"
      id="IVchap64"></a><span class="chapnum">64</span>the Ubii together with
      its other inhabitants.<a name="2fnm406"></a><a href="#2fn406"
      class="2fnnum">406</a> Accordingly the <a name="2fnm407"></a>Tencteri,<a
      href="#2fn407" class="2fnnum">407</a> their nearest neighbours across the
      Rhine, dispatched a deputation to lay a message before a public meeting of
      the town. This was delivered by the haughtiest of the delegates in some
      such terms as these:&mdash;'We give thanks to the national gods of Germany
      and above all others, to the god of war, that you are again incorporate in
      the German nation and the German name, and we congratulate you that you
      will now at last become free members of a free community. Until to-day the
      Romans had closed to us the roads and rivers, and almost the very air of
      heaven, to prevent all intercourse between us; or else they offered a
      still fouler insult to born warriors, that we should meet under
      supervision, unarmed and almost <a name="2fnm408"></a>naked,<a
      href="#2fn408" class="2fnnum">408</a> and should pay for the privilege.
      Now, that our friendly alliance may be ratified for all eternity, we
      demand of you that you pull down those bulwarks of slavery, the walls of
      your town, for even wild beasts lose their spirit if you keep them caged:
      that you put to the sword every Roman on your soil, since tyrants are
      incompatible with freedom; that all the property of those killed form a
      common stock and no one be <a name="2page175"></a><span class="pagenum">175</span>allowed
      to conceal anything or to secure any private advantage. It must also be
      open both for us and for you to live on either river-bank, as our
      forefathers could in earlier days. As daylight is the natural heritage of
      all mankind, so the land of the world is free to all brave men. Resume
      again the customs and manners of your own country and throw off those
      luxurious habits which enslave Rome's subjects far more effectively than
      Roman arms. Then, grown simple and uncorrupt, you will forget your past
      slavery and either know none but equals or hold empire over others.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap65" id="IVchap65"></a><span class="chapnum">65</span>The
      townspeople took time to consider these proposals, and, feeling that their
      apprehensions for the future forbade them to assent, while their present
      circumstances forbade them to return a plain negative, they answered as
      follows: 'We have seized our first opportunity of freedom with more haste
      than prudence, because we wanted to join hands with you and all our other
      German kinsmen. As for our town-walls, seeing that the Roman armies are
      massing at this moment, it would be safer for us to heighten them than to
      pull them down. All the foreigners from Italy or the provinces who lived
      on our soil have either perished in the war or fled to their own homes. As
      for the original <a name="2fnm409"></a>settlers<a href="#2fn409"
      class="2fnnum">409</a>, who are united to us by ties of marriage, they and
      their offspring regard this as their home, and we do not think you are so
      unreason<a name="2page176"></a><span class="pagenum">176</span>able as to
      ask us to kill our parents and brothers and children. All taxes and
      commercial restrictions we remit. We grant you free entry without
      supervision, but you must come in daylight and unarmed, while these ties
      which are still strange and new are growing into a long-established
      custom. As arbitrators we will appoint Civilis and Veleda, and we will
      ratify our compact in their presence.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the Tencteri were pacified. A deputation was sent with presents to
      Civilis and Veleda, and obtained all that the people of Cologne desired.
      They were not, however, allowed to approach and speak to Veleda or even to
      see her, but were kept at a distance to inspire in them the greater awe.
      She herself lived at the top of a high tower, and one of her relatives was
      appointed to carry all the questions and answers like a mediator between
      God and man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap66" id="IVchap66"></a><span class="chapnum">66</span>Now
      that he had gained the accession of Cologne, Civilis determined to win
      over the neighbouring communities or to declare war in case of opposition.
      He reduced the <a name="2fnm410"></a>Sunuci<a href="#2fn410" class="2fnnum">410</a>
      and formed their fighting strength into cohorts, but then found his
      advance barred by Claudius <a name="2fnm411"></a>Labeo<a href="#2fn411"
      class="2fnnum">411</a> at the head of a hastily-recruited band of
      Baetasii, Tungri, and Nervii.<a href="#2fn411" class="2fnnum">411</a> He
      had secured the bridge over the Maas and relied on the strength of his
      position. A skirmish in the narrow defile proved indecisive, until the
      Germans swam across and took Labeo in the rear. At this point<a
      name="2page177"></a><span class="pagenum">177</span> Civilis by a bold
      move&mdash;or possibly by arrangement&mdash;rode into the lines of the
      Tungri and called out in a loud voice, 'Our object in taking up arms is
      not to secure empire for the Batavi and Treviri over other tribes. We are
      far from any such arrogance. Take us as allies. I am come to join you;
      whether as general or as private it is for you to choose.' This had a
      great effect on the common soldiers, who began to sheathe their swords.
      Then two of their chieftains, Campanus and Juvenalis, surrendered the
      entire tribe. Labeo escaped before he was surrounded. Civilis also
      received the allegiance of the Baetasii and Nervii, and added their forces
      to his own. His power was now immense, for all the Gallic communities were
      either terrified or ready to offer willing support.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap67" id="IVchap67"></a><span class="chapnum">67</span>In the
      meantime, Julius <a name="2fnm412"></a>Sabinus,<a href="#2fn412"
      class="2fnnum">412</a> who had destroyed every memorial of the Roman <a
      name="2fnm413"></a>alliance,<a href="#2fn413" class="2fnnum">413</a>
      assumed the title of Caesar and proceeded to hurry a large unwieldy horde

      href="#2fn414" class="2fnnum">414</a> a neighbouring community, faithful
      to Rome. The Sequani accepted battle: the good cause prospered: the
      Lingones were routed. Sabinus fled the field with the same rash haste with
      which he had plunged into battle. Wishing to spread a rumour of his death,
      he took refuge in a house and set fire to it, and was thus supposed to
      have perished by his own act. We shall, however, relate in due course the
      devices by which <a name="2page178"></a><span class="pagenum">178</span>he
      lay in hiding and prolonged his life for nine more years, and allude also

          The story, which Tacitus presumably told in the lost part of his <i>History</i>,
          dealing with the end of Vespasian's reign, is mentioned both by
          Plutarch and Dio. Sabinus and his wife lived for nine years in an
          underground cave, where two sons were born to them. They were
          eventually discovered and executed.

    <h3>
      <a name="Ebb_Tide" id="Ebb_Tide"></a>The Ebb-tide of Revolt
    </h3>
    <p>
      This success on the part of the Sequani checked the rising flood. The
      Gallic communities gradually came to their senses and began to remember
      their obligations as allies. In this movement the <a name="2fnm416"></a>Remi<a
      href="#2fn416" class="2fnnum">416</a> took the lead. They circulated a
      notice throughout Gaul, summoning a meeting of delegates to consider
      whether liberty or peace was the preferable alternative. <a name="IVchap68"
      id="IVchap68"></a><span class="chapnum">68</span>At Rome, however, all
      these disasters were exaggerated, and Mucianus began to feel anxious. He
      had already appointed Annius Gallus and Petilius Cerialis to the chief
      command, and distinguished officers as they were, he was afraid the
      conduct of such a war might be too much for them. Moreover, he could not
      leave Rome without government, but he was afraid of Domitian's unbridled
      passions, while, as we have already seen,<a name="2fnm417"></a><a
      href="#2fn417" class="2fnnum">417</a> he suspected Antonius Primus and
      Arrius Varus. Varus, as commanding the Guards, still had the chief power
      and influence in his hands. Mucianus accordingly displaced him, but, as a
      compensation, made him Director of <a name="2page179"></a><span
      class="pagenum">179</span>the Corn-supply. As he had also to placate
      Domitian, who was inclined to support Varus, he appointed to the command
      of the Guards Arrecinus Clemens, who was connected with Vespasian's <a
      name="2fnm418"></a>family<a href="#2fn418" class="2fnnum">418</a> and very
      friendly with Domitian. He also impressed it upon Domitian that Clemens'
      father had filled this command with great distinction under Caligula: that
      his name and his character would both find favour with the troops, and
      that, although he was a member of the <a name="2fnm419"></a>senate,<a
      href="#2fn419" class="2fnnum">419</a> he was quite able to fill both
      positions. He then chose his staff, some as being the most eminent men in
      the country, others as recommended by private influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus both Domitian and Mucianus made ready to start, but with very
      different feelings. Domitian was full of the sanguine haste of youth,
      while Mucianus kept devising delays to check this enthusiasm. He was
      afraid that if Domitian once seized control of an army, his youthful
      self-assurance and his bad advisers would lead him into action prejudicial
      both to peace and war. Three victorious legions, the Eighth, Eleventh, and
      Thirteenth;<a name="2fnm420"></a><a href="#2fn420" class="2fnnum">420</a>
      the Twenty-first&mdash;one of Vitellius' legions&mdash;and the Second,
      which had been newly enrolled, all started for the front, some by way of
      the Poenine and <a name="2fnm421"></a>Cottian<a href="#2fn421"
      class="2fnnum">421</a> Alps, others over the Graian<a name="2page180"></a><span
      class="pagenum">180</span> <a name="2fnm422"></a>Alps.<a href="#2fn422"
      class="2fnnum">422</a> The Fourteenth was also summoned from Britain, and
      the Sixth and First from Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rumour that this force was on its way, combined with the present
      temper of the Gauls, inclined them to adopt a sober policy. Their
      delegates now met in the territory of the Remi, where they found the
      representatives of the Treviri awaiting them. One of these, Julius
      Valentinus, who was the keenest instigator of a hostile policy, delivered
      a set speech, in which he heaped spiteful aspersions on the Roman people,
      making all the charges which are usually brought against great empires. He
      was a clever agitator, whose mad rhetoric made him popular with the crowd.
      <a name="IVchap69" id="IVchap69"></a><span class="chapnum">69</span>However,
      Julius Auspex, a chieftain of the Remi, enlarged upon the power of Rome
      and the blessings of peace. 'Any coward can begin a war,' he said, 'but it
      is the brave who run the risks of its conduct: and here are the legions
      already upon us.' Thus he restrained them, awakening a sense of duty in
      all the sager breasts, and appealing to the fears of the younger men. So,
      while applauding Valentinus' courage, they followed the advice of Auspex.
      The fact that in 's rising the Treviri and Lingones sided with Verginius
      is known to have told against them in Gaul. Many, too, were held back by
      tribal jealousy. They wanted to know where the head-quarters of the war
      would be, to whom were they to look for auspices and orders, and, if all
      went well, which town would be chosen as the seat of government. Thus
      dissension <a name="2page181"></a><span class="pagenum">181</span>preceded
      victory. They angrily magnified, some their great connexions, others their
      wealth and strength, others their antiquity, until they grew tired of
      discussing the future and voted for the existing state of things. Letters
      were written to the Treviri in the name of All Gaul, bidding them cease
      hostilities, suggesting, however, that pardon might be obtained, and that
      many were ready to plead their cause if they showed repentance. Valentinus
      opposed this mandate and made his tribesmen offer a deaf ear to it. He was
      always less anxious to organize a campaign than to make speeches on every
      possible occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap70" id="IVchap70"></a><span class="chapnum">70</span>The
      result was that neither the Treviri nor the Lingones nor the other rebel
      tribes behaved as if aware of the serious risks they were undertaking.
      Even the leaders did not act in concert. Civilis wandered over the wilds
      of the Belgic country, trying to catch or expel Claudius Labeo. Classicus
      ordinarily took his ease, apparently enjoying the fruits of empire. Even
      Tutor seemed in no hurry to garrison the Upper Rhine and block the Alpine
      passes. In the meantime, the Twenty-first legion made its way down from
      Vindonissa, while Sextilius <a name="2fnm423"></a>Felix<a href="#2fn423"
      class="2fnnum">423</a> advanced through Raetia with some auxiliary
      cohorts. These were joined by the 'Picked Horse',<a name="2fnm424"></a><a
      href="#2fn424" class="2fnnum">424</a> a force that had been raised by
      Vitellius and then deserted to Vespasian. This was commanded by Civilis'
      nephew, Julius Briganticus,<a name="2fnm425"></a><a href="#2fn425"
      class="2fnnum">425</a> for uncle and nephew hated each other <a
      name="2page182"></a><span class="pagenum">182</span>with all the
      aggravated bitterness of near relatives. Tutor swelled his force of
      Treviri with fresh levies from the Vangiones, Triboci, and Caeracates,<a
      name="2fnm426"></a><a href="#2fn426" class="2fnnum">426</a> and a
      stiffening of Roman veterans, both horse and foot, who had either been
      bribed or intimidated. These first cut up an auxiliary cohort sent forward
      by Sextilius Felix, but on the advance of the Roman army with its generals
      they loyally deserted to their old flag, and were followed by the Triboci,
      Vangiones, and Caeracates. Tutor, followed by his Treviri, avoided Mainz
      and fell back on <a name="2fnm427"></a>Bingium,<a href="#2fn427"
      class="2fnnum">427</a> relying on his position there, as he had broken
      down the bridge over the river Nava. However, Sextilius' cohorts followed
      him up; some traitor showed them a ford; Tutor was routed. This disaster
      was a crushing blow to the Treviri. The rank and file dropped their
      weapons and took to the fields, while some of their chieftains, hoping it
      might be thought that they had been the first to lay down arms, took
      refuge among tribes who had never repudiated the Roman alliance. The
      legions which had been moved, as we saw <a name="2fnm428"></a>above,<a
      href="#2fn428" class="2fnnum">428</a> from Novaesium and Bonn to Trier,
      now administered to themselves the oath of allegiance to Vespasian. This
      happened in Valentinus' absence. When he arrived in furious excitement,
      ready to spread universal <a name="2page183"></a><span class="pagenum">183</span>ruin
      and confusion, the legions withdrew into the friendly territory of the
      Mediomatrici.<a name="2fnm429"></a><a href="#2fn429" class="2fnnum">429</a>
      Valentinus and Tutor then led the Treviri forcibly back into the field,
      but first they killed the two Roman officers, Herennius and <a
      name="2fnm430"></a>Numisius.<a href="#2fn430" class="2fnnum">430</a> By
      diminishing the hope of pardon they tried to cement their bond of crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap71" id="IVchap71"></a><span class="chapnum">71</span>Such
      was the position when Petilius Cerialis reached Mainz. His arrival roused
      high hopes. He was himself thirsting for battle, and being always better
      at despising his enemy than at taking precautions, he fired his men by
      delivering a spirited harangue, promising that directly there was a chance
      of getting into touch with the enemy he would engage without delay. He
      dismissed the Gallic recruits to their homes with a message that the
      legions were enough for his task: the allies could resume their peaceful
      occupations, feeling assured that the war was practically ended, now that
      Roman troops had taken it in hand. This action rendered the Gauls all the
      more tractable. They made less difficulty about the war-tax, now that they
      had got their men back again, while his disdain only sharpened their sense
      of duty. On the other side, when Civilis and Classicus heard of Tutor's
      defeat, the destruction of the Treviri, and the universal success of the
      Roman arms, they fell into a panic, hastily mobilized their own scattered
      forces, and kept sending messages to Valentinus not to risk a decisive
      battle. This only hastened Cerialis' movements. He sent <a name="2page184"></a><span
      class="pagenum">184</span>guides to the legions stationed in the country
      of the Mediomatrici to lead them by the shortest route on the enemy's
      rear. Then, assembling all the troops to be found in <a name="2fnm431"></a>Mainz<a
      href="#2fn431" class="2fnnum">431</a> together with his own force, he
      marched in three days to <a name="2fnm432"></a>Rigodulum.<a href="#2fn432"
      class="2fnnum">432</a> Here, on a spot protected by the mountains on one
      side and the Moselle on the other, Valentinus had already taken his stand
      with a large force of Treviri. His camp had been strengthened with
      trenches and stone barricades, but these fortifications had no terrors for
      the Roman general. He ordered the infantry to force the position in front,
      while the cavalry were to ascend the hill. Valentinus' hurriedly assembled
      forces filled him with contempt, for he knew that whatever advantage their
      position might give them, the superior morale of his men would outweigh
      it. A short delay was necessary while the cavalry climbed the hill,
      exposed to the enemy's fire. But when the fight began, the Treviri tumbled
      headlong down the hill like a house falling. Some of our cavalry, who had
      ridden round by an easier gradient, captured several Belgic chieftains,
      including their general, Valentinus.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap72" id="IVchap72"></a><span class="chapnum">72</span>On the
      next day Cerialis entered Trier. The troops clamoured greedily for its
      destruction. 'It was the native town of Classicus and of Tutor: these were
      the men who had wickedly entrapped and slaughtered the legions. Its guilt
      was far worse than that of Cremona, which had been wiped off the face of
      Italy <a name="2page185"></a><span class="pagenum">185</span>for causing
      the victors a single night's delay. Was the chief seat of the rebellion to
      be left standing untouched on the German frontier, glorying in the spoil
      of Roman armies and the blood of Roman generals?<a name="2fnm433"></a><a
      href="#2fn433" class="2fnnum">433</a> The plunder could go to the Imperial
      Treasury. It would be enough for them to see the rebel town in smoking
      ruins; that would be some compensation for the destruction of so many
      camps.' Cerialis was afraid of soiling his reputation if it was said that
      he gave his men a taste for cruelty and riot, so he suppressed their
      indignation. They obeyed him, too, for now that civil war was done with,
      there was less insubordination on foreign service. Their thoughts were now
      distracted by the pitiful plight of the legions who had been summoned from
      the country of the <a name="2fnm434"></a>Mediomatrici.<a href="#2fn434"
      class="2fnnum">434</a> Miserably conscious of their guilt, they stood with
      eyes rooted to the ground. When the armies met, they raised no cheer: they
      had no answer for those who offered comfort and encouragement: they
      skulked in their tents, shunning the light of day. It was not fear of
      punishment so much as the shame of their disgrace which thus overwhelmed
      them. Even the victorious army showed their bewilderment: hardly venturing
      to make an audible petition, they craved pardon for them with silent
      tears. At length Cerialis soothed their alarm. He insisted that all
      disasters due to dissension between officers and men, or to the enemy's
      guile, were to be regarded as 'acts <a name="2page186"></a><span
      class="pagenum">186</span>of destiny'. They were to count this as their
      first day of service and sworn <a name="2fnm435"></a>allegiance.<a

      remember past misdeeds. He then gave them quarters in his own camp, and

      <a name="IVchap73" id="IVchap73"></a><span class="chapnum">73</span>Cerialis
      next summoned the Treviri and Lingones, and addressed them as follows:
      'Unpractised as I am in public speaking, for it is only on the field that
      I have asserted the superiority of Rome, yet since words have so much
      weight with you, and since you distinguish good and bad not by the light
      of facts but by what agitators tell you, I have decided to make a few
      remarks, which, as the war is practically over, are likely to be more
      profitable to the audience than to ourselves. Roman generals and officers
      originally set foot in your country and the rest of Gaul from no motives
      of ambition, but at the call of your ancestors, who were worn almost to
      ruin by dissension. The Germans whom one party summoned to their aid had
      forced the yoke of slavery on allies and enemies alike. You know how often
      we fought against the Cimbri and the Teutons, with what infinite pains and
      with what striking success our armies have undertaken German wars. All
      that is notorious. And to-day it is not to protect Italy that we have
      occupied the Rhine, but to prevent some second Ariovistus making himself
      <a name="2page187"></a><span class="pagenum">187</span>master of All <a
      name="2fnm436"></a>Gaul.<a href="#2fn436" class="2fnnum">436</a> Do you
      imagine that Civilis and his Batavi and the other tribes across the Rhine
      care any more about you than their ancestors cared about your fathers and
      grandfathers? The Germans have always had the same motives for trespassing
      into Gaul&mdash;their greed for gain and their desire to change homes with
      you. They wanted to leave their marshes and deserts, and to make
      themselves masters of this magnificently fertile soil and of you who live
      on it. Of course they use specious pretexts and talk about liberty. No one
      has ever wanted to enslave others and play the tyrant without making use
      of the very same phrases.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap74" id="IVchap74"></a><span class="chapnum">74</span>'Tyranny
      and warfare were always rife throughout the length and breadth of Gaul,
      until you accepted Roman government. Often as we have been provoked, we
      have never imposed upon you any burden by right of conquest, except what
      was necessary to maintain peace. Tribes cannot be kept quiet without
      troops. You cannot have troops without pay; and you cannot raise pay
      without taxation. In every other respect you are treated as our equals.
      You frequently command our legions yourselves: you govern this and other
      provinces yourselves. We have no exclusive privileges. Though you live so
      far away, you enjoy the blessings of a good emperor no less than we do,
      <a name="2page188"></a><span class="pagenum">188</span>whereas the tyrant
      only oppresses his nearest neighbours. You must put up with luxury and
      greed in your masters, just as you put up with bad crops or excessive
      rain, or any other natural disaster. Vice will last as long as mankind.
      But these evils are not continual. There are intervals of good government,
      which make up for them. You cannot surely hope that the tyranny of Tutor
      and Classicus would mean milder government, or that they will need less
      taxation for the armies they will have to raise to keep the Germans and
      Britons at bay. For if the Romans were driven out&mdash;which Heaven
      forbid&mdash;what could ensue save a universal state of intertribal
      warfare? During eight hundred years, by good fortune and good
      organization, the structure of empire has been consolidated. It cannot be
      pulled down without destroying those who do it. And it is you who would
      run the greatest risk of all, since you have gold and rich resources,
      which are the prime causes of war. You must learn, then, to love and
      foster peace and the city of Rome in which you, the vanquished, have the
      same rights as your conquerors. You have tried both conditions. Take
      warning, then, that submission and safety are better than rebellion and
      ruin.' By such words as these he quieted and reassured his audience, who
      had been afraid of more rigorous measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap75" id="IVchap75"></a><span class="chapnum">75</span>While
      the victors were occupying Trier, Civilis and Classicus sent a letter to
      Cerialis, the gist of which was that Vespasian was dead, though the news
      was being suppressed: Rome and Italy were exhausted by civil <a
      name="2page189"></a><span class="pagenum">189</span>war: Mucianus and
      Domitian were mere names with no power behind them: if Cerialis desired to
      be emperor of All Gaul, they would be satisfied with their own territory:
      but if he should prefer battle, that, too, they would not deny him.
      Cerialis made no answer to Civilis and Classicus, but sent the letter and
      its bearer to Domitian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enemy now approached Trier from every quarter in detached bands, and
      Cerialis was much criticized for allowing them to unite, when he might
      have cut them off one by one. The Roman army now threw a trench and
      rampart round their camp, for they had rashly settled in it without seeing
      to the fortifications. <a name="IVchap76" id="IVchap76"></a><span
      class="chapnum">76</span>In the German camp different opinions were being
      keenly debated. Civilis contended that they should wait for the tribes
      from across the Rhine, whose arrival would spread a panic sufficient to
      crush the enfeebled forces of the Romans. The Gauls, he urged, were simply
      a prey for the winning side and, as it was, the Belgae, who were their
      sole strength, had declared for him or were at least sympathetic. Tutor
      maintained that delay only strengthened the Roman force, since their
      armies were converging from every quarter. 'They have brought one legion
      across from Britain, others have been summoned from Spain, or are on their
      way from <a name="2fnm437"></a>Italy.<a href="#2fn437" class="2fnnum">437</a>
      Nor are they raw recruits, but experienced veterans, while the Germans, on
      whose aid we rely, are subject to no discipline or control, but do
      whatever they like. You can only <a name="2page190"></a><span
      class="pagenum">190</span>bribe them with presents of money, and the
      Romans have the advantage of us there: besides, however keen to fight, a
      man always prefers peace to danger, so long as the pay is the same. But if
      we engage them at once, Cerialis has nothing but the remnants of the
      German <a name="2fnm438"></a>army,<a href="#2fn438" class="2fnnum">438</a>
      who have sworn allegiance to the Gallic Empire. The very fact that they
      have just won an unexpected victory over Valentinus' undisciplined <a
      name="2fnm439"></a>bands<a href="#2fn439" class="2fnnum">439</a> serves to
      confirm them and their general in imprudence. They will venture out again
      and will fall, not into the hands of an inexperienced boy, who knows more
      about making speeches than war, but into the hands of Civilis and
      Classicus, at the sight of whom they will recall their fears and their
      flights and their famine, and remember how often they have had to beg
      their lives from their captors. Nor, again, is it any liking for the
      Romans that keeps back the Treviri and Lingones: they will fly to arms
      again, when once their fears are dispelled.' Classicus finally settled the
      difference of opinion by declaring for Tutor's policy, and they promptly
      proceeded to carry it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap77" id="IVchap77"></a><span class="chapnum">77</span>The
      Ubii and Lingones were placed in the centre, the Batavian cohorts on the
      right, and on the left the Bructeri and Tencteri. Advancing, some by the
      hills and some by the path between the road and the <a name="2fnm440"></a>river,<a
      href="#2fn440" class="2fnnum">440</a> <a name="2page191"></a><span
      class="pagenum">191</span> they took us completely by surprise. So sudden
      was their onslaught that Cerialis, who had not spent the night in camp,
      was still in bed when he heard almost simultaneously that the fighting had
      begun and that the day was lost. He cursed the messengers for their
      cowardice until he saw the whole extent of the disaster with his own eyes.
      The camp had been forced, the cavalry routed, and the bridge over the
      Moselle, leading to the outskirts of the town, which lay between him and
      his army,<a href="#2fn440" class="2fnnum">440</a> was held by the enemy.
      But confusion had no terrors for Cerialis. Seizing hold on fugitives,
      flinging himself without any armour into the thick of the fire, he
      succeeded by his inspired imprudence and the assistance of the braver men
      in retaking the bridge. Leaving a picked band to hold it, he hurried back
      to the camp, where he found that the companies of the legions which had
      surrendered at Bonn and <a name="2fnm441"></a>Novaesium<a href="#2fn441"
      class="2fnnum">441</a> were all broken up, few men were left at their
      posts, and the eagles were all but surrounded by the enemy. He turned on
      them in blazing anger, 'It is not Flaccus or Vocula that you are
      deserting. There is no "treason" about me. I have done nothing to be
      ashamed of, except that I was rash enough to believe that you had
      forgotten your Gallic ties and awakened to the memory of your Roman
      allegiance. Am I to be numbered with<a name="2page192"></a><span
      class="pagenum">192</span> Numisius and <a name="2fnm442"></a>Herennius?<a
      href="#2fn442" class="2fnnum">442</a> Then you can say that all your
      generals have fallen either by your hands or the enemy's. Go and tell the
      news to Vespasian, or rather, to Civilis and Classicus&mdash;they are
      nearer at hand&mdash;that you have deserted your general on the field of
      battle. There will yet come legions who will not leave me unavenged or you
      unpunished.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap78" id="IVchap78"></a><span class="chapnum">78</span>All he
      said was true, and the other officers heaped the same reproaches on their
      heads. The men were drawn up in cohorts and companies, since it was
      impossible to deploy with the enemy swarming round them, and, the fight
      being inside the rampart, the tents and baggage were a serious
      encumbrance. Tutor and Classicus and Civilis, each at his post, were busy
      rallying their forces, appealing to the Gauls to fight for freedom, the
      Batavians for glory, and the Germans for plunder. Everything, indeed, went
      well for the enemy until the Twenty-first legion, who had rallied in a
      clearer space than any of the others, first sustained their charge and
      then repulsed them. Then, by divine providence, on the very point of
      victory the enemy suddenly lost their nerve and turned tail. They
      themselves attributed their panic to the appearance of the Roman
      auxiliaries, who, after being scattered by the first charge, formed again
      on the hill-tops and were taken for fresh reinforcements. However, what
      really cost the Gauls their victory was that they let their enemy alone
      and indulged in ignoble squabbles over the spoil. Thus after Cerialis'
      carelessness had <a name="2page193"></a><span class="pagenum">193</span>almost
      caused disaster, his pluck now saved the day, and he followed up his
      success by capturing the enemy's camp and destroying it before nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap79" id="IVchap79"></a><span class="chapnum">79</span>Cerialis'
      troops were allowed short respite. Cologne was clamouring for help and
      offering to surrender Civilis' wife and sister and Classicus' daughter,
      who had been left behind there as pledges of the alliance. In the meantime
      the inhabitants had massacred all the stray Germans to be found in the
      town. They were now alarmed at this, and had good reason to implore aid
      before the enemy should recover their strength and bethink themselves of
      victory, or at any rate of revenge. Indeed, Civilis already had designs on
      Cologne, and he was still formidable, for the most warlike of his cohorts,
      composed of Chauci and <a name="2fnm443"></a>Frisii,<a href="#2fn443"
      class="2fnnum">443</a> was still in full force at <a name="2fnm444"></a>Tolbiacum,<a
      href="#2fn444" class="2fnnum">444</a> within the territory of Cologne.
      However, he changed his plans on receiving the bitter news that this force
      had been entrapped and destroyed by the inhabitants of Cologne. They had
      entertained them at a lavish banquet, drugged them with wine, shut the
      doors upon them and burned the place to the ground. At the same moment
      Cerialis came by forced marches to the relief of Cologne. A further
      anxiety haunted Civilis. He was afraid that the Fourteenth legion, in
      conjunction with the fleet from Britain,<a name="2fnm445"></a><a
      href="#2fn445" class="2fnnum">445</a> might harry <a name="2page194"></a><span
      class="pagenum">194</span>the Batavian coast. However, Fabius Priscus, who
      was in command, led his troops inland into the country of the Nervii and
      Tungri, who surrendered to him. The <a name="2fnm446"></a>Canninefates<a
      href="#2fn446" class="2fnnum">446</a> made an unprovoked attack upon the
      fleet and sank or captured the greater number of the ships. They also
      defeated a band of Nervian volunteers who had been recruited in the Roman
      interest. Classicus secured a further success against an advance-guard of
      cavalry which Cerialis had sent forward to Novaesium. These repeated
      checks, though unimportant in themselves, served to dim the lustre of the
      recent Roman <a name="2fnm447"></a>victory.<a href="#2fn447" class="2fnnum">447</a>

    <h3>
      <a name="Events" id="Events"></a>Events in Rome and in the East
    </h3>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap80" id="IVchap80"></a><span class="chapnum">80</span>It was
      about this time that Mucianus gave orders for the murder of Vitellius'
      <a name="2fnm448"></a>son,<a href="#2fn448" class="2fnnum">448</a> on the
      plea that dissension would continue until all the seeds of war were
      stamped out. He also refused to allow Antonius Primus to go out on
      Domitian's staff, being alarmed at his popularity among the troops and at
      the man's own vanity, which would brook no equal, much less a superior.
      Antonius accordingly went to join Vespasian, whose reception, though not
      hostile, proved a disappointment. The emperor was drawn two ways. On the
      one side were Antonius' services: it was undeniable that his generalship
      had ended the war. In the other scale were Mucianus' letters. Besides <a
      name="2page195"></a><span class="pagenum">195</span>which, every one else
      seemed ready to rake up the scandals of his past life and inveigh against
      his vanity and bad temper. Antonius himself did his best to provoke
      hostility by expatiating to excess on his services, decrying the other
      generals as incompetent cowards, and stigmatizing Caecina as a prisoner
      who had surrendered. Thus without any open breach of friendship he
      gradually declined lower and lower in the emperor's favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap81" id="IVchap81"></a><span class="chapnum">81</span>During
      the months which Vespasian spent at Alexandria waiting for the regular
      season of the summer <a name="2fnm449"></a>winds<a href="#2fn449"
      class="2fnnum">449</a> to ensure a safe voyage, there occurred many
      miraculous events manifesting the goodwill of Heaven and the special
      favour of Providence towards him. At Alexandria a poor workman who was
      well known to have a disease of the eye, acting on the advice of Serapis,
      whom this superstitious people worship as their chief god, fell at
      Vespasian's feet demanding with sobs a cure for his blindness, and
      imploring that the emperor would deign to moisten his eyes and eyeballs
      with the spittle from his mouth. Another man with a maimed hand, also
      inspired by Serapis, besought Vespasian to imprint his footmark on it. At
      first Vespasian laughed at them and refused. But they insisted. Half
      fearing to be thought a fool, half stirred to hopes by their petition and
      by the flattery of his courtiers, he eventually told the doctors to form
      an opinion whether such cases of blindness and deformity <a name="2page196"></a><span
      class="pagenum">196</span>could be remedied by human aid. The doctors
      talked round the question, saying that in the one case the power of sight
      was not extinct and would return, if certain impediments were removed; in
      the other case the limbs were distorted and could be set right again by
      the application of an effective remedy: this might be the will of Heaven
      and the emperor had perhaps been chosen as the divine instrument. They
      added that he would gain all the credit, if the cure were successful,
      while, if it failed, the ridicule would fall on the unfortunate patients.
      This convinced Vespasian that there were no limits to his destiny: nothing
      now seemed incredible. To the great excitement of the bystanders, he
      stepped forward with a smile on his face and did as the men desired him.
      Immediately the hand recovered its functions and daylight shone once more
      in the blind man's eyes. Those who were present still attest both miracles
      to-day,<a name="2fnm450"></a><a href="#2fn450" class="2fnnum">450</a> when
      there is nothing to gain by lying.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap82" id="IVchap82"></a><span class="chapnum">82</span>This
      occurrence deepened Vespasian's desire to visit the holy-place and consult
      Serapis about the fortunes of the empire. He gave orders that no one else
      was to be allowed in the temple, and then went in. While absorbed in his
      devotions, he suddenly saw behind him an Egyptian noble, named Basilides,
      whom he knew to be lying ill several days' journey from Alexandria. He
      inquired of the priests whether Basilides had entered the temple that day.
      He inquired of every one he met whether he had been seen in the city. Even<a
      name="2page197"></a><span class="pagenum">197</span>tually he sent some
      horsemen, who discovered that at the time Basilides was eighty miles away.
      Vespasian therefore took what he had seen for a divine apparition, and
      guessed the meaning of the oracle from the name 'Basilides'.<a
      name="2fnm451"></a><a href="#2fn451" class="2fnnum">451</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap83" id="IVchap83"></a><span class="chapnum">83</span>The
      origins of the god Serapis are not given in any Roman authorities. The
      high-priests of Egypt give the following account: King Ptolemy, who was
      the first of the Macedonians to put the power of Egypt on a firm <a
      name="2fnm452"></a>footing,<a href="#2fn452" class="2fnnum">452</a> was
      engaged in building walls and temples, and instituting religious cults for
      his newly founded city of Alexandria, when there appeared to him in his
      sleep a young man of striking beauty and supernatural stature, who warned
      him to send his most faithful friends to Pontus to fetch his image. After
      adding that this would bring luck to the kingdom, and that its
      resting-place would grow great and famous, he appeared to be taken up into
      heaven in a sheet of flame. Impressed by this miraculous prophecy, Ptolemy
      revealed his vision to the priests of Egypt, who are used to interpreting
      such things. As they had but little knowledge of Pontus or of foreign
      cults, he consulted an Athenian named Timotheus, a member of the Eumolpid
      <a name="2fnm453"></a>clan,<a href="#2fn453" class="2fnnum">453</a> whom
      he had brought over from Eleusis to be overseer of <a name="2page198"></a><span
      class="pagenum">198</span>religious ceremonies, and asked him what worship
      and what god could possibly be meant. Timotheus found some people who had
      travelled in Pontus and learnt from them, that near a town called Sinope
      there was a temple, which had long been famous in the neighbourhood as the
      seat of Jupiter-Pluto,<a name="2fnm454"></a><a href="#2fn454"
      class="2fnnum">454</a> and near it there also stood a female figure, which
      was commonly called Proserpine. Ptolemy was like most despots, easily
      terrified at first, but liable, when his panic was over, to think more of
      his pleasures than of his religious duties. The incident was gradually
      forgotten, and other thoughts occupied his mind until the vision was
      repeated in a more terrible and impressive form than before, and he was
      threatened with death and the destruction of his kingdom if he failed to
      fulfil his instructions. He at once gave orders that representatives
      should be sent with presents to King Scydrothemis, who was then reigning
      at Sinope, and on their departure he instructed them to consult the oracle
      of Apollo at Delphi. They made a successful voyage and received a clear
      answer from the oracle: they were to go and bring back the image of
      Apollo's father but leave his sister's behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap84" id="IVchap84"></a><span class="chapnum">84</span>On
      their arrival at Sinope they laid their presents, their petition, and
      their king's instructions before Scydrothemis. He was in some perplexity.
      He was afraid of the god and yet alarmed by the threats of his subjects,
      who opposed the project: then, again, he often felt tempted by the envoys'
      presents and <a name="2page199"></a><span class="pagenum">199</span>promises.
      Three years passed. Ptolemy's zeal never abated for a moment. He persisted
      in his petition, and kept sending more and more distinguished envoys, more
      ships, more gold. Then a threatening vision appeared to Scydrothemis,
      bidding him no longer thwart the god's design. When he still hesitated, he
      was beset by every kind of disease and disaster: the gods were plainly
      angry and their hand was heavier upon him every day. He summoned an
      assembly and laid before it the divine commands, his own and Ptolemy's
      visions, and the troubles with which they were visited. The king found the
      people unfavourable. They were jealous of Egypt and fearful of their own
      future. So they surged angrily round the temple. The story now grows
      stranger still. The god himself, it says, embarked unaided on one of the
      ships that lay beached on the shore, and by a miracle accomplished the
      long sea-journey and landed at Alexandria within three days. A temple
      worthy of so important a city was then built in the quarter called
      Rhacotis, on the site of an ancient temple of Serapis and <a name="2fnm455"></a>Isis.<a
      href="#2fn455" class="2fnnum">455</a> This is the most widely accepted
      account of the god's origin and arrival. Some people, I am well aware,
      maintain that the god was brought from the Syrian town of Seleucia during
      the <a name="2page200"></a><span class="pagenum">200</span>reign of
      Ptolemy, the third of that <a name="2fnm456"></a>name.<a href="#2fn456"
      class="2fnnum">456</a> Others, again, say it was this same Ptolemy, but
      make the place of origin the famous town of Memphis,<a name="2fnm457"></a><a
      href="#2fn457" class="2fnnum">457</a> once the bulwark of ancient Egypt.
      Many take the god for Aesculapius, because he cures disease: others for
      Osiris, the oldest of the local gods; some, again, for Jupiter, as being
      the sovereign lord of the world. But the majority of people, either
      judging by what are clearly attributes of the god or by an ingenious
      process of conjecture, identify him with Pluto.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap85" id="IVchap85"></a><span class="chapnum">85</span>Domitian
      and Mucianus were now on their way to the Alps.<a name="2fnm458"></a><a
      href="#2fn458" class="2fnnum">458</a> Before reaching the mountains they
      received the good news of the victory over the Treviri, the truth of which
      was fully attested by the presence of their leader Valentinus. His courage
      was in no way crushed and his face still bore witness to the proud spirit
      he had shown. He was allowed a hearing, merely to see what he was made of,
      and condemned to death. At his execution some one cast it in his teeth
      that his country was conquered, to which he replied, 'Then I am reconciled
      to death.'
    </p>
    <p>
      Mucianus now gave utterance to an idea which he had long cherished, though
      he pretended it was a sudden inspiration. This was that, since by Heaven's
      grace the forces of the enemy had been broken, it would ill befit
      Domitian, now that the war was practically <a name="2page201"></a><span
      class="pagenum">201</span>over, to stand in the way of the other generals
      to whom the credit belonged. Were the fortunes of the empire or the safety
      of Gaul at stake, it would be right that a Caesar should take the field;
      the Canninefates and Batavi might be left to minor generals. So Domitian
      was to stay at Lugdunum and there show them the power and majesty of the
      throne at close quarters. By abstaining from trifling risks he would be
      ready to cope with any greater crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="IVchap86" id="IVchap86"></a><span class="chapnum">86</span>The
      ruse was detected, but it could not be unmasked. That was part of the
      courtier's <a name="2fnm459"></a>policy.<a href="#2fn459" class="2fnnum">459</a>
      Thus they proceeded to Lugdunum. From there Domitian is supposed to have
      sent messengers to Cerialis to test his loyalty, and to ask whether the
      general would transfer his army and his allegiance to him, should he
      present himself in person. Whether Domitian's idea was to plan war against
      his father or to acquire support against his brother, cannot be decided,
      for Cerialis parried his proposal with a salutary snub and treated it as a
      boy's day-dream. Realizing that older men despised his youth, Domitian
      gave up even those functions of government which he had hitherto
      performed. Aping bashfulness and simple tastes, he hid his feelings under
      a cloak of impenetrable reserve, professing literary tastes and a passion
      for poetry. Thus he concealed his real self and withdrew from all rivalry
      with his brother, whose gentler and altogether different nature he
      perversely misconstrued.

          It is evident from these words that the worship of Serapis was ancient
          in Egypt. It seems to be suggested that the arrival of this statue
          from Pontus did not originate but invigorated the cult of Serapis.
          Pluto, Dis, Serapis, are all names for a god of the underworld.
          Jupiter seems added vaguely to give more power to the title. We cannot
          expect accurate theology from an amateur antiquarian.

          According to Eustathius there was a Mount Sinopium near Memphis. This
          suggests an origin for the title Sinopitis, applied to Serapis, and a
          cause for the invention of the romantic story about Sinope in Pontus.

      <a name="Vchap1" id="Vchap1"></a><span class="chapnum">1</span>Early in
      this same <a name="2fnm460"></a>year<a href="#2fn460" class="2fnnum">460</a>
      Titus Caesar had been entrusted by his father with the task of completing
      the reduction of Judaea.<a name="2fnm461"></a><a href="#2fn461"
      class="2fnnum">461</a> While he and his father were both still private
      citizens, Titus had distinguished himself as a soldier, and his reputation
      for efficiency was steadily increasing, while the provinces and armies
      vied with one another in their enthusiasm for him. Wishing to seem
      independent of his good fortune, he always showed dignity and energy in
      the field. His affability called forth devotion. He constantly helped in
      the trenches and could mingle with his soldiers on the march without
      compromising his dignity as general. Three legions awaited him in Judaea,
      the Fifth, Tenth, and Fifteenth, all veterans from his father's army.
      These were reinforced by the Twelfth from Syria and by detachments of the
      Twenty-second and the <a name="2fnm462"></a>Third,<a href="#2fn462"
      class="2fnnum">462</a> brought over from Alexandria. This force was
      accompanied by twenty auxiliary cohorts and eight regiments of auxiliary
      cavalry besides the Kings Agrippa and Sohaemus, King Antiochus' <a
      name="2fnm463"></a>irregulars,<a href="#2fn463" class="2fnnum">463</a> a
      strong force of Arabs, who had a neighbourly hatred for the Jews, and a
      crowd of persons who had come from Rome and the rest of Italy, each
      tempted by the hope of securing <a name="2page203"></a><span
      class="pagenum">203</span>the first place in the prince's still unoccupied
      affections. With this force Titus entered the enemy's country at the head
      of his column, sending out scouts in all directions, and holding himself
      ready to fight. He pitched his camp not far from Jerusalem.

    <p>
      <a name="Vchap2" id="Vchap2"></a><span class="chapnum">2</span>Since I am
      coming now to describe the last days of this famous city, it may not seem
      out of place to recount here its early history. It is said that the Jews
      are refugees from <a name="2fnm464"></a>Crete,<a href="#2fn464"
      class="2fnnum">464</a> who settled on the confines of Libya at the time
      when Saturn was forcibly deposed by Jupiter. The evidence for this is
      sought in the name. Ida is a famous mountain in Crete inhabited by the
      <a name="2fnm465"></a>Idaei,<a href="#2fn465" class="2fnnum">465</a> whose
      name became lengthened into the foreign form Judaei. Others say that in
      the reign of Isis the superfluous population of Egypt, under the
      leadership of Hierosolymus and Juda, discharged itself upon the
      neighbouring districts, while there are many who think the Jews an
      Ethiopian stock, driven to migrate by their fear and dislike of King <a
      name="2fnm466"></a>Cepheus.<a href="#2fn466" class="2fnnum">466</a>
      Another tradition makes them Assyrian refugees,<a name="2fnm467"></a><a
      href="#2fn467" class="2fnnum">467</a> who, <a name="2page204"></a><span
      class="pagenum">204</span>lacking lands of their own, occupied a district
      of Egypt, and later took to building cities of their own and tilling
      Hebrew territory and the frontier-land of Syria. Yet another version
      assigns to the Jews an illustrious origin as the descendants of the Solymi&mdash;a
      tribe famous in <a name="2fnm468"></a>Homer<a href="#2fn468" class="2fnnum">468</a>&mdash;who
      founded the city and called it Hiero<i>solyma</i> after their own <a

    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Vchap3" id="Vchap3"></a><span class="chapnum">3</span>Most
      authorities agree that a foul and disfiguring disease once broke out in
      Egypt, and that King <a name="2fnm470"></a>Bocchoris,<a href="#2fn470"
      class="2fnnum">470</a> on approaching the oracle of Ammon and inquiring
      for a remedy, was told to purge his kingdom of the plague and to transport
      all who suffered from it into some other country, for they had earned the
      disfavour of Heaven. A motley crowd was thus collected and abandoned in
      the desert. While all the other outcasts lay idly lamenting, one of them,
      named Moses, advised them not to look for help to gods or men, since both
      had deserted them, but to trust rather in themselves and accept as divine
      the guidance of the first being by whose aid they should get out of their
      present plight. They agreed, and set out blindly to march wherever chance
      might lead them.<a name="2page205"></a><span class="pagenum">205</span>
      Their worst distress came from lack of water. When they were already at
      death's door and lying prostrate all over the plain, it so happened that a
      drove of wild asses moved away from their pasture to a rock densely
      covered with trees. Guessing the truth from the grassy nature of the
      ground, Moses followed and disclosed an ample flow of <a name="2fnm471"></a>water.<a
      href="#2fn471" class="2fnnum">471</a> This saved them. Continuing their
      march for six successive days, on the seventh they routed the natives and
      gained possession of the country. There they consecrated their city and
      their temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Vchap4" id="Vchap4"></a><span class="chapnum">4</span>To ensure
      his future hold over the people, Moses introduced a new cult, which was
      the opposite of all other religions. All that we hold sacred they held
      profane, and allowed practices which we abominate. They dedicated in a
      shrine an image of the <a name="2fnm472"></a>animal<a href="#2fn472"
      class="2fnnum">472</a> whose guidance had put an end to their wandering
      and thirst. They killed a ram, apparently as an insult to Ammon, and also
      sacrificed a bull, because the Egyptians worship the bull <a name="2fnm473"></a>Apis.<a
      href="#2fn473" class="2fnnum">473</a> Pigs are subject to leprosy; so they
      abstain from pork in memory of their misfortune and the foul plague with
      which they were once infected. Their frequent <a name="2fnm474"></a>fasts<a
      href="#2fn474" class="2fnnum">474</a> bear <a name="2page206"></a><span
      class="pagenum">206</span>witness to the long famine they once endured,
      and, in token of the corn they carried off, Jewish bread is to this day
      made without leaven. They are said to have devoted the seventh day to
      rest, because that day brought an end to their troubles.<a name="2fnm475"></a><a
      href="#2fn475" class="2fnnum">475</a> Later, finding idleness alluring,
      they gave up the seventh year as well to <a name="2fnm476"></a>sloth.<a
      href="#2fn476" class="2fnnum">476</a> Others maintain that they do this in
      honour of Saturn;<a name="2fnm477"></a><a href="#2fn477" class="2fnnum">477</a>
      either because their religious principles are derived from the Idaei, who
      are supposed to have been driven out with Saturn and become the ancestors
      of the Jewish people; or else because, of the seven constellations which
      govern the lives of men, the star of Saturn moves in the topmost orbit and
      exercises peculiar influence, and also because most of the heavenly bodies
      move <a name="2fnm478"></a>round<a href="#2fn478" class="2fnnum">478</a>
      their courses in multiples of seven.

    <p>
      <a name="Vchap5" id="Vchap5"></a><span class="chapnum">5</span>Whatever
      their origin, these rites are sanctioned by their antiquity. Their other
      customs are impious and abominable, and owe their prevalence to their
      depravity. For all the most worthless rascals, renouncing their national
      cults, were always sending money to swell the sum of offerings and <a
      name="2fnm479"></a>tribute.<a href="#2fn479" class="2fnnum">479</a> This
      is one cause of Jewish prosperity. Another is that they <a name="2page207"></a><span
      class="pagenum">207</span>are obstinately loyal to each other, and always
      ready to show compassion, whereas they feel nothing but hatred and enmity
      for the rest of the <a name="2fnm480"></a>world.<a href="#2fn480"
      class="2fnnum">480</a> They eat and sleep separately. Though immoderate in
      sexual indulgence, they refrain from all intercourse with foreign women:
      among themselves anything is <a name="2fnm481"></a>allowed.<a
      href="#2fn481" class="2fnnum">481</a> They have introduced circumcision to
      distinguish themselves from other people. Those who are converted to their
      customs adopt the same practice, and the first lessons they learn are to
      despise the <a name="2fnm482"></a>gods,<a href="#2fn482" class="2fnnum">482</a>
      to renounce their country, and to think nothing of their parents,
      children, and brethren. However, they take steps to increase their
      numbers. They count it a crime to kill any of their later-born <a
      name="2fnm483"></a>children,<a href="#2fn483" class="2fnnum">483</a> and
      they believe that the souls of those who die in battle or under
      persecution are <a name="2fnm484"></a>immortal.<a href="#2fn484"
      class="2fnnum">484</a> Thus they think <a name="2page208"></a><span
      class="pagenum">208</span>much of having children and nothing of facing
      death. They prefer to bury and not burn their <a name="2fnm485"></a>dead.<a
      href="#2fn485" class="2fnnum">485</a> In this, as in their burial rites,
      and in their belief in an underworld, they conform to Egyptian custom.
      Their ideas of heaven are quite different. The Egyptians worship most of
      their gods as animals, or in shapes half animal and half human. The Jews
      acknowledge one god only, of whom they have a purely spiritual conception.
      They think it impious to make images of gods in human shape out of
      perishable materials. Their god is almighty and inimitable, without
      beginning and without end. They therefore set up no statues in their
      temples, nor even in their cities, refusing this homage both to their own
      kings and to the Roman emperors. However, the fact that their priests
      intoned to the flute and cymbals and wore wreaths of ivy, and that a
      golden vine was found in their <a name="2fnm486"></a>temple<a
      href="#2fn486" class="2fnnum">486</a> has led some people to think that
      they worship <a name="2fnm487"></a>Bacchus,<a href="#2fn487" class="2fnnum">487</a>
      who has so enthralled the East. But their cult would be most
      inappropriate. Bacchus instituted gay and cheerful rites, but the Jewish
      ritual is preposterous and morbid.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="2page209"></a><span class="pagenum">209</span><a name="Vchap6"
      id="Vchap6"></a><span class="chapnum">6</span>The country of the Jews is
      bounded by Arabia on the east, by Egypt on the south, and on the west by
      Phoenicia and the sea. On the Syrian frontier they have a distant view
      towards the <a name="2fnm488"></a>north.<a href="#2fn488" class="2fnnum">488</a>
      Physically they are healthy and hardy. Rain is rare; the soil infertile;
      its products are of the same kind as ours with the addition of balsam and
      palms. The palm is a tall and beautiful tree, the balsam a mere shrub.
      When its branches are swollen with sap they open them with a sharp piece
      of stone or crockery, for the sap-vessels shrink up at the touch of iron.
      The sap is used in medicine. Lebanon, their chief mountain, stands always
      deep in its eternal snow, a strange phenomenon in such a burning climate.
      Here, too, the river Jordan has its <a name="2fnm489"></a>source<a
      href="#2fn489" class="2fnnum">489</a> and comes pouring down, to find a
      home in the sea. It flows undiminished through first one lake, then
      another, and loses itself in a <a name="2fnm490"></a>third.<a
      href="#2fn490" class="2fnnum">490</a> This last is a lake of immense size,
      like a sea, though its water has a foul taste and a most unhealthy smell,
      which poisons the surrounding inhabitants. No wind can stir waves in it:
      no fish or sea-birds can live there. The sluggish water supports whatever
      is thrown on to it, as if its surface were solid, while those who cannot
      swim float on it as easily as those who can. Every year at the same time
      the lake yields asphalt. As with other arts, it is experience which shows
      how to collect it. It is a black liquid which, when congealed with a <a
      name="2page210"></a><span class="pagenum">210</span>sprinkling of vinegar,
      floats on the surface of the water. The men who collect it take it in this
      state into their hands and haul it on deck. Then without further aid it
      trickles in and loads the boat until you cut off the stream. But this you
      cannot do with iron or brass: the current is turned by applying blood or a
      garment stained with a woman's menstrual discharge. That is what the old
      authorities say, but those who know the district aver that floating blocks
      of asphalt are driven landwards by the wind and dragged to shore by hand.
      The steam out of the earth and the heat of the sun dries them, and they
      are then split up with axes and wedges, like logs or blocks of stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Vchap7" id="Vchap7"></a><span class="chapnum">7</span>Not far
      from this lake are the Plains, which they say were once fertile and
      covered with large and populous cities which were destroyed by <a
      name="2fnm491"></a>lightning.<a href="#2fn491" class="2fnnum">491</a>
      Traces of the cities are said to remain, and the ground, which looks
      scorched, has lost all power of production. The plants, whether wild or
      artificially cultivated, are blighted and sterile and wither into dust and
      ashes, either when in leaf or flower, or when they have attained their
      full growth. Without denying that at some date famous cities were there
      burnt up by lightning, I am yet inclined to think that it is the
      exhalation from the lake which infects the soil and poisons the
      surrounding atmosphere. Soil and climate being equally deleterious, the
      crops and fruits all rot away.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="2page211"></a><span class="pagenum">211</span>The river Belus
      also falls into this Jewish sea. Round its mouth is found a peculiar kind
      of sand which is mixed with native soda and smelted into glass. Small
      though the beach is, its product is inexhaustible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Vchap8" id="Vchap8"></a><span class="chapnum">8</span>The greater
      part of the population live in scattered villages, but they also have
      towns. Jerusalem is the Jewish capital, and contained the temple, which
      was enormously wealthy. A first line of fortifications guarded the city,
      another the palace, and an innermost line enclosed the <a name="2fnm492"></a>temple.<a
      href="#2fn492" class="2fnnum">492</a> None but a Jew was allowed as far as
      the doors: none but the priests might cross the threshold.<a name="2fnm493"></a><a
      href="#2fn493" class="2fnnum">493</a> When the East was in the hands of
      the Assyrians, Medes and Persians, they regarded the Jews as the meanest
      of their slaves. During the Macedonian <a name="2fnm494"></a>ascendancy<a
      href="#2fn494" class="2fnnum">494</a> King <a name="2fnm495"></a>Antiochus<a
      href="#2fn495" class="2fnnum">495</a> endeavoured to abolish their
      superstitions and to introduce Greek manners and customs. But Arsaces at
      that moment <a name="2fnm496"></a>rebelled,<a href="#2fn496" class="2fnnum">496</a>
      and the Parthian war prevented him from effecting any improvement in the
      character of this grim people. Then, when Macedon waned, as the Parthian
      power was not yet ripe and Rome was <a name="2page212"></a><span
      class="pagenum">212</span>still far away, they took kings of their <a
      name="2fnm497"></a>own.<a href="#2fn497" class="2fnnum">497</a> The mob
      were fickle and drove them out. However, they recovered their throne by
      force; banished their countrymen, sacked cities, slew their brothers,
      wives, and parents, and committed all the usual kingly crimes. But this
      only fostered the hold of the Jewish religion, since the kings had
      strengthened their authority by assuming the priesthood.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Vchap9" id="Vchap9"></a><span class="chapnum">9</span>Cnaeus
      Pompeius was the first Roman to subdue the Jews and set foot in their
      temple by right of <a name="2fnm498"></a>conquest.<a href="#2fn498"
      class="2fnnum">498</a> It was then first realized that the temple
      contained no image of any god: their sanctuary was empty, their mysteries
      meaningless. The walls of Jerusalem were destroyed, but the temple was
      left standing. Later, during the Roman civil wars, when the eastern
      provinces had come under the control of Mark Antony, the Parthian Prince
      Pacorus seized Judaea,<a name="2fnm499"></a><a href="#2fn499"
      class="2fnnum">499</a> and was killed by Publius Ventidius. The Parthians
      were driven back over the Euphrates, and Caius <a name="2fnm500"></a>Sosius<a
      href="#2fn500" class="2fnnum">500</a> subdued the Jews. Antony gave the
      kingdom to <a name="2fnm501"></a>Herod,<a href="#2fn501" class="2fnnum">501</a>
      and Augustus, after his victory, enlarged it. After Herod's death,
      somebody called<a name="2page213"></a><span class="pagenum">213</span>
      Simon,<a name="2fnm502"></a><a href="#2fn502" class="2fnnum">502</a>
      without awaiting the emperor's decision, forcibly assumed the title of
      king. He was executed by Quintilius Varus, who was Governor of Syria; the
      Jews were repressed and the kingdom divided between three of Herod's <a
      name="2fnm503"></a>sons.<a href="#2fn503" class="2fnnum">503</a> Under
      Tiberius all was quiet. Caligula ordered them to put up his statue in the
      temple. They preferred war to that. But Caligula's death put an end to the
      rising.<a name="2fnm504"></a><a href="#2fn504" class="2fnnum">504</a> In
      Claudius' reign the kings had all either died or lost most of their
      territory. The emperor therefore made Judaea a province to be governed by
      Roman knights or freedmen. One of these, Antonius <a name="2fnm505"></a>Felix,<a
      href="#2fn505" class="2fnnum">505</a> indulged in every kind of cruelty
      and immorality, wielding a king's authority with all the instincts of a
      slave. He had married Drusilla, a granddaughter of Antony and Cleopatra,
      so that he was Antony's grandson-in-law, while Claudius was Antony's <a
      name="2fnm506"></a>grandson.<a href="#2fn506" class="2fnnum">506</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Vchap10" id="Vchap10"></a><span class="chapnum">10</span>The Jews
      endured such oppression patiently until the time of Gessius <a
      name="2fnm507"></a>Florus,<a href="#2fn507" class="2fnnum">507</a> under
      whom war broke out. Cestius Gallus, the Governor of Syria, tried to crush
      it, but met with more reverses than victories. He died, either in the
      natural course or perhaps of disgust, and Nero sent out Vespasian, who, in
      a couple of campaigns,<a name="2fnm508"></a><a href="#2fn508"
      class="2fnnum">508</a> thanks to his reputation, good fortune, and able
      subordinates, had the whole of the country <a name="2page214"></a><span
      class="pagenum">214</span>districts and all the towns except Jerusalem
      under the heel of his victorious army. The next <a name="2fnm509"></a>year<a
      href="#2fn509" class="2fnnum">509</a> was taken up with civil war, and
      passed quietly enough as far as the Jews were concerned. But peace once
      restored in Italy, foreign troubles began again with feelings embittered
      on our side by the thought that the Jews were the only people who had not
      given in. At the same time it seemed best to leave Titus at the head of
      the army to meet the eventualities of the new reign, whether good or bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Vchap11" id="Vchap11"></a><span class="chapnum">11</span>Thus, as
      we have already <a name="2fnm510"></a>seen,<a href="#2fn510" class="2fnnum">510</a>
      Titus pitched his camp before the walls of Jerusalem and proceeded to
      display his legions in battle order. The Jews formed up at the foot of
      their own walls, ready, if successful, to venture further, but assured of
      their retreat in case of reverse. A body of cavalry and some light-armed
      foot were sent forward, and fought an indecisive engagement, from which
      the enemy eventually retired. During the next few days a series of
      skirmishes took place in front of the gates, and at last continual losses
      drove the Jews behind their walls. The Romans then determined to take it
      by storm. It seemed undignified to sit and wait for the enemy to starve,
      and the men all clamoured for the risks, some being really brave, while
      many others were wild and greedy for plunder. Titus himself had the vision
      of Rome with all her wealth and pleasures before his eyes, and felt that
      their enjoyment was postponed unless Jerusalem fell at once. The city,
      however, stands high and is <a name="2page215"></a><span class="pagenum">215</span>fortified
      with works strong enough to protect a city standing on the plain. Two
      enormous <a name="2fnm511"></a>hills<a href="#2fn511" class="2fnnum">511</a>
      were surrounded by walls ingeniously built so as to project or slope
      inwards and thus leave the flanks of an attacking party exposed to fire.
      The rocks were jagged at the top. The towers, where the rising ground
      helped, were sixty feet high, and in the hollows as much as a hundred and
      twenty. They are a wonderful sight and seem from a distance to be all of
      equal height. Within this runs another line of fortification surrounding
      the palace, and on a conspicuous height stands the Antonia, a castle named
      by Herod in honour of Mark Antony.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Vchap12" id="Vchap12"></a><span class="chapnum">12</span>The
      temple was built like a citadel with walls of its own, on which more care
      and labour had been spent than on any of the others. Even the cloisters
      surrounding the temple formed a splendid rampart. There was a
      never-failing spring of <a name="2fnm512"></a>water,<a href="#2fn512"
      class="2fnnum">512</a> catacombs hollowed out of the hills, and pools or
      cisterns for holding the rain-water. Its original builders had foreseen
      that the peculiarities of Jewish life would lead to frequent wars,
      consequently everything was ready for the longest of sieges. Besides this,
      when Pompey took the city, bitter experience taught them <a name="2page216"></a><span
      class="pagenum">216</span>several lessons, and in the days of Claudius
      they had taken advantage of his avarice to buy rights of fortification,
      and built walls in peace-time as though war were imminent. Their numbers
      were now swelled by floods of human refuse and unfortunate refugees from
      other <a name="2fnm513"></a>towns.<a href="#2fn513" class="2fnnum">513</a>
      All the most desperate characters in the country had taken refuge there,
      which did not conduce to unity. They had three armies, each with its own
      general. The outermost and largest line of wall was held by Simon; the
      central city by John, and the temple by <a name="2fnm514"></a>Eleazar.<a
      href="#2fn514" class="2fnnum">514</a> John and Simon were stronger than
      Eleazar in numbers and equipment, but he had the advantage of a strong
      position. Their relations mainly consisted of fighting, treachery, and
      arson: a large quantity of corn was burnt. Eventually, under pretext of
      offering a sacrifice, John sent a party of men to massacre Eleazar and his
      troops, and by this means gained possession of the <a name="2fnm515"></a>temple.<a
      href="#2fn515" class="2fnnum">515</a> Thus Jerusalem was divided into two
      hostile parties, but on the approach of the Romans the necessities of
      foreign warfare reconciled their differences.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Vchap13" id="Vchap13"></a><span class="chapnum">13</span>Various
      portents had occurred at this time, but so sunk in superstition are the
      Jews and so opposed to all religious practices that they think it wicked
      <a name="2page217"></a><span class="pagenum">217</span>to avert the
      threatened evil by <a name="2fnm516"></a>sacrifices<a href="#2fn516"
      class="2fnnum">516</a> or vows. Embattled armies were seen to meet in the
      sky with flashing arms, and the temple shone with sudden fire from heaven.
      The doors of the shrine suddenly opened, a supernatural voice was heard
      calling the gods out, and at once there began a mighty movement of
      departure. Few took alarm at all this. Most people held the belief that,
      according to the ancient priestly writings, this was the moment at which
      the East was fated to prevail: they would now start forth from Judaea and
      conquer the world.<a name="2fnm517"></a><a href="#2fn517" class="2fnnum">517</a>
      This enigmatic prophecy really applied to Vespasian and Titus. But men are
      blinded by their hopes. The Jews took to themselves the promised destiny,
      and even defeat could not convince them of the truth. The number of the
      besieged, men and women of every age, is stated to have reached six
      hundred thousand. There were arms for all who could carry them, and far
      more were ready to fight than would be expected from their total numbers.
      The women were as determined as the men: if they were forced to leave
      their homes they had more to fear in life than in death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the city and such the people with which<a name="2page218"></a><span
      class="pagenum">218</span> Titus was faced. As the nature of the ground
      forbade a sudden assault, he determined to employ siege-works and
      penthouse shelters. The work was accordingly divided among the legions,
      and there was a truce to fighting until they had got ready every means of
      storming a town that had ever been devised by experience or inventive
      ingenuity.

          There seems little to recommend Tacitus' theory of the identity of the
          Idaei and Judaei, though it has been suggested that the Cherethites of
          2. Sam. viii. 18 and Ezek. xxv. 16 are Cretans, migrated into the
          neighbourhood of the Philistines. The Jewish Sabbath (Saturn's day)
          seems also to have suggested connexion with Saturn and Crete.

          <i>Agnati</i>, as used here and in <i>Germ.</i> 19 means a child born
          after the father has made his will and therein specified the number of
          his children. The mere birth of such a child invalidated any earlier
          will that the father had made, but the fact of its birth might be
          concealed by making away with the baby. This crime seems to have been
          not uncommon, but there is no evidence that 'exposure of infants' was

      <a name="End_Revolt" id="End_Revolt"></a>The End of the German Revolt
    </h3>
    <p>
      <a name="Vchap14" id="Vchap14"></a><span class="chapnum">14</span>After
      the severe reverse at <a name="2fnm518"></a>Trier<a href="#2fn518"
      class="2fnnum">518</a> Civilis recruited his army in Germany, and pitched
      his camp near Vetera. The position was a safe one, and he hoped to
      inspirit his native troops with the memory of their former victories <a
      name="2fnm519"></a>there.<a href="#2fn519" class="2fnnum">519</a> Cerialis
      followed in his footsteps, with forces now doubled by the arrival of the
      Second,<a name="2fnm520"></a><a href="#2fn520" class="2fnnum">520</a>
      Thirteenth, and Fourteenth legions, besides auxiliary troops, both horse
      and <a name="2fnm521"></a>foot,<a href="#2fn521" class="2fnnum">521</a>
      who had long received their summons and came hurrying on the news of
      victory. Neither general was dilatory, but a vast plain lay between them.
      It was by nature swampy, and Civilis had built a dam projecting into the
      Rhine, which stemmed the current and flooded the adjacent fields. The
      treacherous nature of the ground, where the shallows were hard to find,
      told against our men, who were heavily armed and afraid <a name="2page219"></a><span
      class="pagenum">219</span>of swimming. The Germans, on the other hand,
      were used to rivers, lightly armed, and tall enough to keep their heads
      above water.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Vchap15" id="Vchap15"></a><span class="chapnum">15</span>Provoked
      by the Batavi, the bravest of our troops opened the engagement at once,
      but soon fell into a panic when their arms and horses began to sink in the
      deep marshes. The Germans, who knew the fords, came leaping across them,
      often leaving our front alone and running round to the flanks or the rear.
      It was not like an infantry engagement at close quarters, but more like a
      naval battle. The men floundered about in the water or, finding firm
      foothold, strove with all their might for possession of it. Thus, wounded
      and whole, those who could swim and those who could not, struggled
      helplessly with each other and perished all alike. However, considering
      the confusion, our loss was less than might have been expected, for the
      Germans, not daring to venture out of the marsh, withdrew to their camp.
      The result of this engagement gave each of the generals a different motive
      for hastening on a decisive battle. Civilis wanted to follow up his
      success, Cerialis to wipe out his disgrace. Success stimulated the pride
      of the Germans; the Romans thrilled with shame. The natives spent the
      night singing uproariously, while our men muttered angry threats.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Vchap16" id="Vchap16"></a><span class="chapnum">16</span>At
      daybreak Cerialis formed up his cavalry and the auxiliary cohorts on his
      front, with the legions behind them, while he himself held a picked body
      in reserve for emergencies. Civilis did not deploy his line, but <a
      name="2page220"></a><span class="pagenum">220</span>halted them in <a
      name="2fnm522"></a>columns,<a href="#2fn522" class="2fnnum">522</a> with
      the Batavi and <a name="2fnm523"></a>Cugerni<a href="#2fn523"
      class="2fnnum">523</a> on his right, and the forces from across the <a
      name="2fnm524"></a>Rhine<a href="#2fn524" class="2fnnum">524</a> near the
      river on the left. Neither general followed the usual custom of haranguing
      the whole army. They rode along and addressed their various divisions in
      turn. Cerialis spoke of the ancient glory of the Roman name and of all
      their victories old and new. He urged them 'to blot out for ever their
      treacherous and cowardly enemy whom they had already beaten. They had to
      punish not to fight them. They had just fought against superior numbers
      and had yet routed the Germans, and, moreover, the pick of their troops.
      This remnant had their hearts full of panic and all their wounds behind
      them.' He then gave special encouragement to each of the legions, calling
      the Fourteenth the conquerors of <a name="2fnm525"></a>Britain,<a
      href="#2fn525" class="2fnnum">525</a> reminding the Sixth that the
      influence of their example had set Galba on the <a name="2fnm526"></a>throne,<a
      href="#2fn526" class="2fnnum">526</a> and telling the Second that in the
      coming fight they would for the first time dedicate their new colours and
      their new eagle to Rome's <a name="2fnm527"></a>service.<a href="#2fn527"
      class="2fnnum">527</a> Then riding along to the German <a name="2fnm528"></a>army,<a
      href="#2fn528" class="2fnnum">528</a> he pointed with his hand and bade
      them recover their own river-bank and their own <a name="2fnm529"></a>camp<a
      href="#2fn529" class="2fnnum">529</a> at the enemy's expense. They all
      cheered with hearts the lighter for his words. Some longed for <a
      name="2page221"></a><span class="pagenum">221</span>battle after a long
      spell of quiet: others were weary of war and pined for peace, hoping that
      the future would bring them rest and recompense.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Vchap17" id="Vchap17"></a><span class="chapnum">17</span>Nor was
      there silence in Civilis' lines. As he formed them up he appealed to the
      spot as evidence of their valour. The Germans and Batavians were standing,
      he told them, 'on the field of their glory, trampling the charred bones of
      Roman soldiers under foot. Wherever the Romans turned their eyes they saw
      nothing but menacing reminders of surrender and defeat. They must not be
      alarmed by that sudden change of fortune in the battle at Trier. It was
      their own victory which hampered the Germans there: they had dropped their
      weapons and filled their hands with loot. Since then everything had gone
      in their favour and against the Romans. He had taken every possible
      precaution, as befitted a cunning general. They themselves were familiar
      with these soaking plains, but the swamps would be a deadly trap for the
      enemy. They had the Rhine and the gods of Germany before their eyes, and
      in the might of these they must go to battle, remembering their wives and
      parents and their fatherland. This day would either gild the glory of
      their ancestors or earn the execration of posterity.' They applauded his
      words according to their custom by dancing and clashing their arms, and
      then opened the battle with showers of stones and leaden balls and other
      missiles, trying to lure on our men, who had not yet entered the marsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Vchap18" id="Vchap18"></a><span class="chapnum">18</span>Their
      missiles exhausted, the enemy warmed to their work and made an angry
      charge. Thanks to their <a name="2page222"></a><span class="pagenum">222</span>great
      height and their very long spears they could thrust from some distance at
      our men, who were floundering and slipping about in the marsh. While this
      went on, a <a name="2fnm530"></a>column<a href="#2fn530" class="2fnnum">530</a>
      of Batavi swam across from the dam which, as we described <a name="2fnm531"></a>above,<a
      href="#2fn531" class="2fnnum">531</a> had been built out into the Rhine.
      This started a panic and the line of our auxiliaries began to be driven
      back. Then the legions took up the fight and equalized matters by staying
      the enemy's wild charge. Meanwhile a Batavian deserter approached
      Cerialis, avowing that he could take the enemy in the rear if the cavalry
      were sent round the edge of the swamp: the ground was solid there, and the
      Cugerni, whose task it was to keep watch, were off their guard. Two
      squadrons of horse were sent with the deserter, and succeeded in
      outflanking the unsuspecting enemy. The legions in front, when the din
      told them what had happened, redoubled their efforts. The Germans were
      beaten and fled to the Rhine. This day might have brought the war to an
      end, had the Roman <a name="2fnm532"></a>fleet<a href="#2fn532"
      class="2fnnum">532</a> arrived in time. As it was, even the cavalry were
      prevented from pursuit by a sudden downpour of rain shortly before
      nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Vchap19" id="Vchap19"></a><span class="chapnum">19</span>On the
      next day the Fourteenth legion were sent to join Annius <a name="2fnm533"></a>Gallus<a
      href="#2fn533" class="2fnnum">533</a> in Upper Germany, and their place in
      Cerialis' army was filled by the Tenth from Spain. Civilis was reinforced
      by the <a name="2fnm534"></a>Chauci.<a href="#2fn534" class="2fnnum">534</a>
      Feeling <a name="2page223"></a><span class="pagenum">223</span>that he was
      not strong enough to hold the Batavian <a name="2fnm535"></a>capital,<a
      href="#2fn535" class="2fnnum">535</a> he took whatever was portable with
      him, burnt everything else, and retired into the island. He knew that the
      Romans had not enough ships to build a bridge, and that they had no other
      means of getting across. He also destroyed the mole built by Drusus <a
      name="2fnm536"></a>Germanicus.<a href="#2fn536" class="2fnnum">536</a> As
      the bed of the Rhine here falls towards Gaul, his removal of all obstacles
      gave it free course; the river was practically diverted, and the channel
      between the Germans and the island became so small and dry as to form no
      barrier between them. Tutor and Classicus also crossed the <a
      name="2fnm537"></a>Rhine,<a href="#2fn537" class="2fnnum">537</a> together
      with a hundred and thirteen town-councillors from Trier, among whom was
      Alpinius Montanus, who, as we have already <a name="2fnm538"></a>seen,<a
      href="#2fn538" class="2fnnum">538</a> had been sent by Antonius Primus
      into Gaul. He was accompanied by his brother. By arousing sympathy and by
      offering presents, the others, too, were all busy raising reinforcements
      among these eagerly adventurous tribes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Vchap20" id="Vchap20"></a><span class="chapnum">20</span>The war
      was far from being over. Dividing his forces, Civilis suddenly made a
      simultaneous attack on all four Roman garrisons&mdash;the Tenth at
      Arenacum, the Second at Batavodurum, and the auxiliary horse and <a
      name="2page224"></a><span class="pagenum">224</span>foot at Grinnes and at
      <a name="2fnm539"></a>Vada.<a href="#2fn539" class="2fnnum">539</a>
      Civilis himself, Verax his nephew, Classicus and Tutor each led one of the
      attacking parties. They could not hope all to be successful, but reckoned
      that, if they made several ventures, fortune would probably favour one or
      the other. Besides, Cerialis, they supposed, was off his guard; on
      receiving news from several places at once he would hurry from one
      garrison to another, and might be cut off on his way. The party told off
      against the Tenth considered it no light task to storm a legion, so they
      fell on the soldiers, who had come outside to cut timber, and killed the
      camp-prefect, five senior centurions, and a handful of the men. The rest
      defended themselves in the trenches. Meanwhile another party of Germans
      endeavoured to break the <a name="2fnm540"></a>bridge<a href="#2fn540"
      class="2fnnum">540</a> which had been begun at Batavodurum, but nightfall
      put an end to the battle before it was won.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Vchap21" id="Vchap21"></a><span class="chapnum">21</span>The
      attack on Grinnes and Vada proved more formidable. Civilis led the assault
      on Vada, Classicus on Grinnes. Nothing could stop them. The bravest of the
      defenders had fallen, among them, commanding a cavalry squadron,
      Briganticus, whom we have seen already, as a faithful ally of Rome and a
      bitter enemy of his uncle Civilis.<a name="2fnm541"></a><a href="#2fn541"
      class="2fnnum">541</a> However, when Cerialis came to the rescue with a
      picked troop of horse, the tables were turned, and the Germans were <a
      name="2page225"></a><span class="pagenum">225</span>driven headlong into
      the river. While Civilis was trying to stop the rout he was recognized,
      and finding himself a target, he left his horse and swam across the river.
      Verax escaped in the same way, while some boats put in to fetch Tutor and
      Classicus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even now the Roman fleet had not joined the army. They had, indeed,
      received orders, but fear held them back, and the rowers were employed on
      various duties elsewhere. It must be admitted, also, that Cerialis did not
      give them time enough to carry out his orders. He was a man of sudden
      resolves and brilliant successes. Even when his strategy had failed, good
      luck always came to his rescue. Thus neither he nor his army cared much
      about discipline. A few days later, again, he narrowly escaped being taken
      prisoner and did not escape disgrace. <a name="Vchap22" id="Vchap22"></a><span
      class="chapnum">22</span>He had gone to Novaesium and Bonn to inspect the
      winter quarters that were being built for his legions, and was returning
      with the <a name="2fnm542"></a>fleet.<a href="#2fn542" class="2fnnum">542</a>
      The Germans noticed that his <a name="2fnm543"></a>escort<a href="#2fn543"
      class="2fnnum">543</a> straggled, and that watch was carelessly kept at
      night. So they planned a surprise. Choosing a night black with clouds they
      slipped down stream and made their way unmolested into the camp.<a
      name="2fnm544"></a><a href="#2fn544" class="2fnnum">544</a> For the first
      onslaught they called cunning to their aid. They cut the tent-ropes and
      slaughtered the soldiers as they struggled under their own canvas. Another
      party fell on the ships, threw <a name="2page226"></a><span class="pagenum">226</span>hawsers
      aboard, and towed them off. Having surprised the camp in dead silence,
      when once the carnage began they added to the panic by making the whole
      place ring with shouts. Awakened by their wounds the Romans hunted for
      weapons and rushed along the <a name="2fnm545"></a>streets,<a
      href="#2fn545" class="2fnnum">545</a> some few in uniform, most of them
      with their clothes wrapped round their arms and a drawn sword in their
      hand. The general, who was half-asleep and almost naked, was only saved by
      the enemy's mistake. His flag-ship being easily distinguishable, they
      carried it off, thinking he was there. But Cerialis had been spending the
      night elsewhere; as most people believed, carrying on an intrigue with a
      Ubian woman named Claudia Sacrata. The sentries sheltered their guilt
      under the general's disgrace, pretending that they had orders to keep
      quiet and not disturb him: so they had dispensed with the bugle-call and
      the challenge on rounds, and dropped off to sleep themselves. In full
      daylight the enemy sailed off with their captive vessels and towed the
      flag-ship up the Lippe as an offering to Veleda.<a name="2fnm546"></a><a
      href="#2fn546" class="2fnnum">546</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Vchap23" id="Vchap23"></a><span class="chapnum">23</span>Civilis
      was now seized with a desire to make a naval display. He manned all the
      available biremes and all the ships with single banks of oars, and added
      to this fleet an immense number of small craft. These carry thirty or
      forty men apiece and are rigged like Illyrian <a name="2fnm547"></a>cruisers.<a
      href="#2fn547" class="2fnnum">547</a> The small craft he had <a
      name="2fnm548"></a>captured<a href="#2fn548" class="2fnnum">548</a> were
      <a name="2page227"></a><span class="pagenum">227</span>worked with bright,
      parti-coloured plaids, which served as sails and made a fine show. He
      chose for review the miniature sea of water where the Rhine comes pouring
      down to the ocean through the mouth of the <a name="2fnm549"></a>Maas.<a
      href="#2fn549" class="2fnnum">549</a> His reason for the demonstration&mdash;apart
      from Batavian vanity&mdash;was to scare away the provision-convoys that
      were already on their way from Gaul. Cerialis, who was less alarmed than
      astonished, at once formed up a fleet. Though inferior in numbers, he had
      the advantage of larger ships, experienced rowers, and clever pilots. The
      Romans had the stream with them, the Germans the wind. So they sailed past
      each other, and after trying a few shots with light missiles they parted.
      Civilis without more ado retired across the <a name="2fnm550"></a>Rhine.<a
      href="#2fn550" class="2fnnum">550</a> Cerialis vigorously laid waste the
      island of the Batavi, and employed the common device of leaving Civilis's
      houses and fields <a name="2fnm551"></a>untouched.<a href="#2fn551"
      class="2fnnum">551</a> They were now well into autumn. The heavy
      equinoctial rains had set the river in flood and thus turned the marshy,
      low-lying island into a sort of lake. Neither fleet nor provision-convoys
      had arrived, and their camp on the flat plain began to be washed away by
      the force of the current.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="2page228"></a><span class="pagenum">228</span><a name="Vchap24"
      id="Vchap24"></a><span class="chapnum">24</span>Civilis afterwards claimed
      that at this point the Germans could have crushed the Roman legions and
      wanted to do so, but that he had cunningly dissuaded them. Nor does this
      seem far from true, since his surrender followed in a few days' time.
      Cerialis had been sending secret messages, promising the Batavians peace
      and Civilis pardon, urging Veleda and her <a name="2fnm552"></a>relatives<a
      href="#2fn552" class="2fnnum">552</a> to change the fortune of a war that
      had only brought disaster after disaster, by doing a timely service to
      <a name="2fnm553"></a>Rome.<a href="#2fn553" class="2fnnum">553</a> 'The
      Treviri,' he reminded them, 'had been slaughtered; the allegiance of the
      Ubii recovered; the Batavians robbed of their home. By supporting Civilis
      they had gained nothing but bloodshed, banishment, and bereavement. He was
      a fugitive exile, a burden to those who harboured him. Besides, they had
      earned blame enough by crossing the Rhine so often: if they took any
      further steps,&mdash;from the one side they might expect insult and
      injury, from the other vengeance and the wrath of heaven.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Vchap25" id="Vchap25"></a><span class="chapnum">25</span>Thus
      Cerialis mingled threats and promises. The loyalty of the tribes across
      the Rhine was shaken, and murmurs began to make themselves heard among the
      Batavi. 'How much further is our ruin to go?' they asked. 'One tribe
      cannot free the whole world from the yoke. What good have we done by
      slaughtering and burning Roman legions except to bring out others, larger
      and stronger? If it was to help Vespasian that we have fought so
      vigorously, Vespasian is master of the world. If we are challenging Rome&mdash;what
      an <a name="2page229"></a><span class="pagenum">229</span>infinitesimal
      fraction of the human race we Batavians are! We must remember what burdens
      Raetia and Noricum and all Rome's other allies bear. From us they levy no
      tribute, only our manhood and our men.<a name="2fnm554"></a><a
      href="#2fn554" class="2fnnum">554</a> That is next door to freedom. And,
      after all, if we have to choose our masters, it is less disgrace to put up
      with Roman emperors than with German priestesses.' Thus the common people:
      the chieftains used more violent language. 'It was Civilis' lunacy that
      had driven them to war. He wanted to remedy his private <a name="2fnm555"></a>troubles<a
      href="#2fn555" class="2fnnum">555</a> by ruining his country. The
      Batavians had incurred the wrath of heaven by blockading Roman legions,
      murdering Roman officers, and plunging into a war which was useful for one
      of them and deadly for the rest. Now they had reached the limit, unless
      they came to their senses and openly showed their repentance by punishing
      the culprit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="Vchap26" id="Vchap26"></a><span class="chapnum">26</span>Civilis
      was well aware of their changed feelings and determined to forestall them.
      He was tired of hardship, and he felt, besides, that desire to live which
      so often weakens the resolution of the bravest spirits. He demanded an
      interview. The bridge over the river <a name="2fnm556"></a>Nabalia<a
      href="#2fn556" class="2fnnum">556</a> was broken down in the middle, and
      the two generals advanced on to the broken ends. Civilis began as follows:
      'If I were defending myself before one of Vitellius' officers, I could
      expect neither <a name="2page230"></a><span class="pagenum">230</span>pardon
      for my conduct nor credence for my words. Between him and me there has
      been nothing but hatred. He began the quarrel, I fostered it. Towards
      Vespasian I have from the beginning shown respect. When he was a private
      citizen, we were known as friends. Antonius Primus was aware of this when
      he wrote urging me to take up arms to prevent the legions from Germany and
      the Gallic levies from crossing the <a name="2fnm557"></a>Alps.<a
      href="#2fn557" class="2fnnum">557</a> The instructions which Antonius gave
      in his letter Hordeonius Flaccus ratified by word of mouth. I raised the
      standard in Germania, as did Mucianus in Syria, Aponius in Moesia,
      Flavianus in Pannonia....'

          This mole, begun by Drusus in <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 9, was
          built out from the left bank of the Rhine near Cleves. It turned most
          of the water into the Lek, thus making the island easily accessible
          from the Roman side and barring access from the north. Civilis now
          reversed this position. His friends were now on the north. The swollen
          Waal would be an obstacle to the Romans.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
